1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
It's a really important thing for people

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,720
to have a realization about the nature

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,759
of reality. Our body, the biology all

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,719
around us have a common cause. There is

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
a fundamental field at the source of

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,640
creation. I've been working on unifying

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,680
all this for 35 years from the scales of

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,240
the cosmology to the scales of quantum

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,960
mechanics which currently is fractured

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,279
in our physics. And that's a big

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,119
problem. If you access this all of a

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,760
sudden you realize the infinite nature

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
of your existence the incredible

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,239
potential that you hold. We've called

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,879
intuition intuition as almost a

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,600
derogatory word where in fact intuition

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
is the most valuable. It's like the

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,120
universe is talking to you and are you

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
listening? There's a really bright

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
future for humanity if we are able to

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,270
bring this level of information

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,640
[Music]

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,320
out. Hey everyone, welcome back to know

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
thyself. Our guest today is a physicist

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
and a researcher who's been shaking up

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,560
the scientific community with his

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
revolutionary theories and ideas ranging

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
on everything from the structure of

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,799
spaceime to the very nature of

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
consciousness. His unified field theory

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
work suggests a universe that's

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
fundamentally connected at levels we're

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
only beginning to comprehend and we'll

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
be exploring the implications that his

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
idea has on human potential, who we are

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
and understanding our place in the

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
cosmos. Nassim Haramein, it's an honor to

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
have you here. Thank you so much for

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
having me. So great to be here with you.

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
Yeah. Yeah. Really been looking forward

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
to this for just meeting with you and

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,240
connecting and eventually doing this

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
podcast for a while. And so let's just

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,240
dive right in. Right on. Yeah. Let's

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
skip the weather conversation. Yeah.

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
How's the weather, the sports? Um,

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
straight into the structure of spaceime

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
and the nature of reality and the nature

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
of reality. Exactly. You know, start

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
with the easy stuff. Yeah. Yeah. The

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,719
light stuff. Um, so I'm curious just

52
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,719
like in your elevator pitch or like

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
trying to give a highle overview of your

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
work to somebody in 30 seconds, how

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
would you explain what you feel like

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
you're here to do on the planet and what

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
your work is really about? Well, that's

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,560
a big one. Um I I I

59
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,879
think it's a really important thing for

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,599
people to have a realization about the

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,680
nature of

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,160
reality like that uh coherence and

63
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,040
self-organizing systems that we are in

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,200
uh our body the biology all around us um

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,239
the structure even of solar systems and

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
galaxies and all this have a common

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
cause that there is a fundamental field

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,280
at the source of creation that's

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
producing all the effects we see at the

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
physical level and the biological level

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,959
and to unify all this from the scales of

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,640
the cosmology to the scales of quantum

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,640
mechanics which currently is fractured

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,319
in our physics and that's a big problem

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
so I've been working on unifying all

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
this for 35 years and there's

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
technological applications that come out

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
of it that are really transformative for

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
society. Uh a new way of extracting

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
energy, a new way of dealing with

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,319
gravity and so on. So, so there's a lot,

82
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
you know, to unpack there. A lot of your

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
theories refer to reality as a sort of

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
holographic in nature. How do you

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
explain what that is to somebody who's

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
not familiar with that term of like a

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
holographic universe? The idea that

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
every point contains the whole is what I

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,959
mean by

90
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,480
holographic. Um so I I use it loosely.

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,400
Um, in the

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,920
holographic mass solution that I've

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,159
published in 2012, it's more specific to

94
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,280
the way that I am um, uh, using the

95
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,760
equations to describe like a surface to

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,839
volume ratio which has been loosely

97
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,040
called holographic in physics. There's a

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,479
thing in physics called the holographic

99
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,680
principle that has to do with the

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
entropy of a black hole. And so without

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
getting too technical, basically it says

102
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
that the entropy of the black hole is

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
equivalent to one quarter of the

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,320
information on the on its surface that's

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,880
holographically imprinted on the

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,800
surface. And the entropy is like the the

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
thermal emission, the the diffusion of

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,759
energy of this of this object if you'd

109
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,280
like. And I showed that this diffusion

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,160
of the surface of the event horizon of a

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
black hole is actually what gives mass

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,320
to the proton. that the proton, the

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,199
nuclear of an atom is like a mini black

114
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,199
hole that's diffusing energy Hawking

115
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,280
radiation and that that energy is what

116
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,600
we call the mass of the proton. But that

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,080
the internal energy of a proton is much

118
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
much higher than the mass we measure.

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm really looking forward to unpacking

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,000
how the hole is weaved within the part

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,759
and how the information is contained

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,400
from you on the level of a proton

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
throughout the whole cosmos. Could you

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
unpack how you're coming at the

125
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
understanding of what spaceime is and

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
how it's made up of these little grains

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,759
or pixels in a way? Right. So let's

128
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
start with the beginning but but maybe

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
like let's do a little parenthesis just

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
to complete what you were saying. If we

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,639
do it like really naively uh the

132
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,919
holographic principle appears when

133
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,639
you're counting the number of grains in

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
the volume of the proton and you find

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
that it's equivalent in terms of energy

136
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
or information as all the other protons

137
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,600
in the universe. So that each proton

138
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
contains the whole which is a principle

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,800
uh it's a principle of

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,960
holography but uh let's start from the

141
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,479
beginning let's um when Mox plunk

142
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,680
uh started quantum mechanics he did so

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,919
because he was giving the task to make a

144
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,319
better light bulb and the light bulbs at

145
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,600
the time were burning out too fast and

146
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
uh He was asked if he could help to make

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
a better one. He was a famous physicist.

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,759
People thought he could help. And he

149
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
looked at the theories of the time and

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
they predicted something goofy about

151
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,479
light, you know, the emission of

152
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
thermodynamic emission or the

153
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,120
electromagnetic emission of a heating

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
body. uh it said that the emission

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
should have infinite amount of

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
ultraviolet. It was called the

157
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
ultraviolet catastrophe. Uh and when we

158
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,680
were measuring the ultraviolet of a

159
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
light bulb in the laboratory, we weren't

160
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,560
seeing infinite amount of ultraviolet.

161
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,919
So, so pl okay how can I fix this

162
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,280
equation? And in fixing it, he added

163
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,039
like a fudge factor. Okay, he called H a

164
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,479
constant that became plunk's constant.

165
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
And basically pe your listener needs to

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,880
know a little bit of quantum mechanics.

167
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,479
Basically these equations are describing

168
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
an oscillator, a harmonic oscillator,

169
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,160
which is usually represented as a spring

170
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
with a weight. But but the universe

171
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
doesn't do springs and weights. I mean,

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
it does after it's it's made the human

173
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
that makes the spring and the weight.

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
So, it's really kind of a bad uh visual

175
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
to use. Although it's the visual that's

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
taught to students typically when

177
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
they're learning quantum mechanics. The

178
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,280
oscillator is best visualized as a

179
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,120
little spinning top, right? That's

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,440
oscillating and it's absorbing photons

181
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
and emitting photons, right? So he

182
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,559
described like the little heat that's

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,839
coming off the filament of the light as

184
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
like oscillators and the and the

185
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,039
constantly put in there, you know, like

186
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
eventually like imagine you're

187
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,480
describing the atom as a little

188
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,279
oscillator, right? and um and the

189
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,160
constant that he put in there to make it

190
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
work so it gave the right answer on the

191
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
spectra of you know light that comes off

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,600
the filament. Um it predicted something

193
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,720
weird. It predicted all the correct

194
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,600
values for the different temperatures

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
having different colors of the spectra,

196
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,959
right? which is the plunk's law but uh

197
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,680
and it got rid of the infinities for the

198
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,160
ultraviolet but it predicted something

199
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,600
more than that. It predicted that

200
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,760
um there would be you know at zero

201
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,560
caline when there's no thermal

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,320
uh agitation there should be no energy

203
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
but what the equation predicted is that

204
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
there's an infinite amount of energy at

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,200
zero caline and so plunk called it 0

206
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
point

207
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,560
energy and that's the and and so

208
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,959
basically It said something really weird

209
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,040
as well. It said that the constant EA

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,200
added called H and then eventually H bar

211
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,680
meant that the oscillator doesn't

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,279
continuously emit

213
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,000
um electromagnetic field like thermal

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,600
radiation but it does so in packets of

215
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
energy. So it builds energy and then it

216
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,440
release a packet. It builds or it only

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
absorbs packets. You understand? And so

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
it was saying something that was not

219
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
instinctive to him that like they would

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,079
be

221
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,360
packets you know and eventually Einstein

222
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
took these packets called them photons

223
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,079
and described the photoelectric effect

224
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,240
which he won the Nobel Prize for. So

225
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
these packets or quanta of energy

226
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,839
started quantum mechanics and I was as I

227
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,600
was

228
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,519
saying the

229
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,200
equation on top of it said something

230
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
weird about the foundation or the ground

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
state of the electromagnetic field

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
instead of saying that at zero Calvin

233
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,680
when everything is frozen and the little

234
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,000
oscillator should be frozen and nothing

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
is happening.

236
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,640
it should have zero energy. Instead, it

237
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,160
said it had infinite of amount of energy

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
like that. There was a bath of infinite

239
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
amount of energy at the ground state of

240
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
the electromagnetic field. And so in the

241
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
paper we just published, we start with

242
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,839
that because actually this history of 0

243
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
point energy is not necessarily well

244
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,760
thought and well understood by the

245
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,880
scientific community. And um the the the

246
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,519
the fact that mathematically you cannot

247
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
remove the zero point energy is not

248
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,640
necessarily well understood neither

249
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,519
because in history what we did is we

250
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,320
remove that ground state because they

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,240
didn't know what to do with an infinite

252
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
amount of energy. They didn't like that

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
answer. So they and and it's not clear

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,639
you know it was the time of the war.

255
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
people were racing to make the atomic

256
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,880
the atomic bomb. Maybe it was removed on

257
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,639
purpose, you know, because maybe we

258
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,279
didn't want certain countries to have an

259
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
idea that there's infinite amount of

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,639
energy available and they were trying to

261
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,760
create vision at the time and so on of

262
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,519
the nuclear of the atom. They maybe that

263
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
was removed on purpose but but anyway it

264
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
was removed and we showed that that

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
makes quantum mechanically quantum

266
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,440
mechanic u mathematically

267
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,720
inconsistent technically it makes the

268
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,079
equation commutative when it should be

269
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,480
non-commutative that is the little

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
oscillator is absorbing photons and

271
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,000
emitting photons right by removing the Z

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
by removing the zero point energy it's

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
like you remove the source of energy if

274
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
we go back to the spring if you stop

275
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,800
doing this the spring is going to stop

276
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,680
oscillating right it has to have a

277
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,519
source so when you remove the zero point

278
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
energies like you remove the source of

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
the oscillator you still can do math on

280
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
the oscillator and get the right answer

281
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,079
and all this but now the oscillator

282
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,040
physically is making miss missing the

283
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
source of energy to make it oscillate.

284
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
Do you understand? Kind of. Yeah. Like

285
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,200
your your car wheel is like an

286
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,600
oscillator, right? It's spinning, but

287
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,920
you have to put energy in the motor for

288
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
the wheel to turn. Mhm. If you remove

289
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
the energy, right, you could still do

290
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,279
the math of a wheel turning as if it

291
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,600
didn't need energy, but in the real

292
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
world, it does, right? So all the

293
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
oscillators that makes up the atoms,

294
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
like the atoms being these little

295
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,880
oscillators that absorbing photons and

296
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
emitting photons, well, they wouldn't be

297
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,079
able to continue if they didn't have

298
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,680
this source of energy in these

299
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,480
equations. And to remove it is

300
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,760
inappropriate. So we demonstrate that

301
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,360
initially and then we eventually show

302
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
that that source of energy is actually

303
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
the source of mass for the atom.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
So, how I want to try to make this as

305
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,680
accessible as possible for our listeners

306
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
that are tuning in. Sorry, I'm trying to

307
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
say it simply. No, I mean you're it's

308
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
it's the it's the most immense task to

309
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
try to squeeze down decades of research

310
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
and work into deep quantum mechanics and

311
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,199
physics into a you know a concise way.

312
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
So, I'm just curious like in the

313
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
transition of paradigm of our

314
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
understanding of the structure of

315
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
spaceime these packets of energy. Yeah.

316
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
What's the implication if what the work

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,399
you're doing is continues to be proven

318
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
and shown that your theories are true?

319
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,240
Like what is that? The implication is

320
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,160
that oh okay the the source of the

321
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
material world like the atoms the energy

322
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
that runs the protons that makes the

323
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,480
proton go is not some miracle energy

324
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
that we've called the big bang. Mhm.

325
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Right. which is about as good as like

326
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
dogma in religions where they just tell

327
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
you well God made it which doesn't

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
really tell you what that is God or what

329
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
is the big bang like how did all the

330
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,000
energy in the big bang arrive and and

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
why is it keeping everything going after

332
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,240
it bang right why is it not stopping why

333
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
is it even accelerating in the universe

334
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
like you know there's So it all of a

335
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
sudden grounds this into no no there's a

336
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,399
source of energy that was found hund you

337
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
like over a hundred years ago already at

338
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
the start of quantum mechanics but that

339
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,199
was ignored um that's actually feeding

340
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,480
all this reality into existence. It's

341
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
like continuously feeding because the

342
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
little oscillator when we think

343
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
oscillation we have a tendency of

344
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
thinking linearly right like a spring

345
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
going up and down or a thing oscillating

346
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
but it's oscillating because it's

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
spinning. Mhm. Okay. And so it would

348
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
have stopped spinning like seconds after

349
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
the so-called big bang if it didn't have

350
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
a source of energy. So what I'm saying

351
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,600
is that the the implication is that all

352
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
of a sudden we realize there's a source

353
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
of energy that's running this world and

354
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,000
we we wrote this math analytically. It's

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
beautiful. It outputs the mass of the

356
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,399
atom but as well it it outputs the

357
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,959
forces that we measure at the atomic

358
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,240
level and at the cosmological level. It

359
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,760
predicts gravity and so on. And so it's

360
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,119
actually saying this this there's only

361
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
one thing there's the flow of this

362
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,799
energy and this energy that this field

363
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
is producing all of our reality and now

364
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
we're applying it to biopysics and

365
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,559
finding like scaling from that

366
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,280
fundamental field you find that it's the

367
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,160
energy at the source of biology as well.

368
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,679
So in this work as we continue to unpack

369
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,120
this the various different fundamental

370
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
constituents and structures of of

371
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,919
reality like I know since 1999 you've

372
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,640
been ex doing experiments spinning

373
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
plasma at high velocities and under and

374
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
seeing how it could potentially be

375
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,360
possible to control gravity and bend

376
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,880
spaceime and you know use those

377
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
curvatures. Yeah. So how does this

378
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
change our understanding of what gravity

379
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
is and how we can uh navigate it,

380
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
manipulate it and so on? Yeah, it's

381
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
really important because you know

382
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
remember this ground state energy called

383
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
zero point energy is an electromagnetic

384
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,240
ground state. So it's

385
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,000
electromagnetic oscillation that are

386
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,640
occurring at the very fine level of the

387
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
structure of spaceime super fine like

388
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,679
billions of times smaller than the atom

389
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,880
is the wavelength of this oscillation so

390
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
it's and so it's really high frequency

391
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
really high energy people say you know

392
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
this is something that your listener

393
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,280
might ask like why am I not feeling it

394
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,480
if it's so much energy or you know well

395
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,880
you know like the the the the microwaves

396
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
that are running, you know, your phone,

397
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
uh, you know, or, you know, the radio

398
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,559
wave in the environment right now,

399
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
you're not feeling neither. Doesn't mean

400
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,320
they're not there, right? They're

401
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
clearly there and we use them all the

402
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
time. Well, this is a field that's like

403
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
so remote in terms of energy and

404
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,440
frequency from our current scale that we

405
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,799
don't experience it directly. Right? So,

406
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,720
and so um but we measure it. It's called

407
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,280
the Casmir effect. We know it's there.

408
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,039
So later on after blanc long after you

409
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
know even kasmir which wrote these

410
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,919
equations in 47 we were able in

411
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,679
laboratory to measure it in

412
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,240
1997 and you know we we were able to

413
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
like show that um you can create a

414
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
little gradient in the zero point energy

415
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,080
and get force. So we we we calculated

416
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,280
the gradient of this energy when it's

417
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,440
inside like a little structure like a

418
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
proton, the nuclear of an atom. If the

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,120
nucle of an atom is a little smoothie of

420
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,400
that energy if you'd like and we

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
calculated the pressure it would produce

422
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,080
and we got the strong force, we got the

423
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
color force. We got the forces that we

424
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
measure in the nuclei of the atom in

425
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,640
terms of the pressure of this field onto

426
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,919
the atomic structure. And then we

427
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,559
calculated that this pressure changes as

428
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,720
you move away from the atom and

429
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,760
eventually becomes gravity.

430
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
And so all of a sudden you have a direct

431
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,000
relationship between this 0 point

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,520
electromagnetic field and the

433
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,640
gravitational field. And we can control

434
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
electromagnetic field. So we can create

435
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
our own little

436
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,159
smoothie to create our own little

437
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,039
gravitational anomaly or gradient in a

438
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,440
region of space. And that would allow us

439
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
to control gravity. And we we built this

440
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,760
whole society because we learned how to

441
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,240
control electromagnetic fields. The next

442
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,799
step for humanity is to actually learn

443
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,400
to control gravitational field which

444
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,880
could like free humanity. In what way

445
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,080
you talking about the engineering

446
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,679
applications of being able to travel

447
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,880
throughout the cosmos? Yeah. You know,

448
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
if you have gravity control, uh you're

449
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,880
not needing to burn thousands of tons of

450
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,960
fuel to like get some rocket into orbit.

451
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,799
You can actually levitate um you know a

452
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
a ship uh right into the atmosphere very

453
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,200
rapidly. You could go to Jupiter for the

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,760
weekend. I mean like it it changes

455
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,360
fundamentally. And and it might sound

456
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
completely outrageous what I'm telling

457
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,400
you right now, but think about a week

458
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,280
before the Wright brothers flew the

459
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,520
first plane. If you went in their

460
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,120
village and told people that in a few uh

461
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,760
weeks somebody the two brothers over

462
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,000
there that are making bicycles, they're

463
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
going to bring, you know, a few thousand

464
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,080
pounds of material up in the air with

465
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,559
them on it. You know, they would have

466
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,799
thought you were insane. And actually,

467
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,840
they would have good support to think

468
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
that because there was hundreds of

469
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
papers published in physics in

470
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
peer-reviewed journal showing that it

471
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,280
was not possible. That sounded like over

472
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,000
unity. That sounded like free energy at

473
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,159
the time. The idea that you could push

474
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,240
air right enough fast enough that you

475
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,200
could create enough lift to lift the

476
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
thing that's making the air circulate.

477
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
Sounded like not possible, right? And so

478
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
there was many papers showing that that

479
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
was not possible. But then the Wright

480
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
brothers did it anyway, right? And so,

481
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,880
you know, the idea that we can control

482
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
gravity and that we can make spaceship

483
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
that can levitate and and go visit our

484
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
solar system very rapidly and have

485
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,720
access to almost infinite amount of

486
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
resources and and completely transform

487
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
our society. Uh might sound like really

488
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,039
out there, you know, currently, but it's

489
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,760
really just one invention. And it's an

490
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
invention that I don't think is actually

491
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,039
that hard to

492
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,039
make if you understand where gravity

493
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,640
comes from which common current theory

494
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,200
doesn't meaning Einstein told us gravity

495
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,080
is the result of curvature of spacetime

496
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
but didn't say what spacetime is right

497
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
what is spacetime what is that thing

498
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,320
that's curving and what I'm showing

499
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,960
clearly in those papers is that

500
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
spacetime is 0 point energy. It's the

501
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
quantum brain that is flowing like a

502
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,799
fluid in spaceime.

503
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
Okay, so this is very exciting and I

504
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,799
want to keep unpacking this but just as

505
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,360
a sidebar because it came up, you know,

506
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
through and I think it would be good

507
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
throughout this whole conversation, you

508
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,679
know, there's so much overlap between

509
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,000
the new novel discovery um and

510
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
scientific thought that's emerging with

511
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,679
ancient wisdom, tradition knowledge

512
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
about human potential and who we are.

513
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
You know, many have said we are made in

514
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,919
the image and likeness of God. We are

515
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,760
vibrational beings that can attune

516
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
ourselves to different states and

517
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,600
frequencies. And I'm just curious as

518
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
somebody who's been for a while at the

519
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,000
forefront of discovery of like new novel

520
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
thought.

521
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,440
What do you feel about if we are

522
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
connected to the whole like you said if

523
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
it's imprinted in the parts what do you

524
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
think uh is the reality of us being able

525
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,120
to attune to these new discoveries like

526
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
the Wright brothers perhaps like like

527
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
new discovery where people thought for

528
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
thousands of years that it would be

529
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
completely impossible and then now we

530
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
just is everyday life right and so for

531
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
somebody who is at the forefront of what

532
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
may be revolutionary and its

533
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,679
implications for integrating into

534
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,960
society what do you think about um being

535
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
able to tune in and attune yourself to

536
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
those discoveries before they come in.

537
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,520
Well, I think they have a really

538
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
fundamental

539
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,640
um philosophical and spiritual meaning,

540
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
these discoveries. That's the thing.

541
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,760
It's not just nice physics to unify

542
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,279
physics and nice uh engineering to make

543
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,679
technology. It actually is telling you

544
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,559
something very profound about the nature

545
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,440
of your existence. is saying that you're

546
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
connected to a field of information.

547
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,840
That field is fundamental to your

548
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,440
existence that it's nourishing. It's

549
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,600
what actually make the coherent process

550
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
in your body possible. And so that you

551
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
can attune to this you know this field

552
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,919
of information or this field of energy 0

553
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,799
point energy it was already there in

554
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
ancient civilization all around the

555
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,799
world. They had all kinds of names for

556
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,200
it. In the Polynesian island it was

557
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,960
called mana. There was um you know uh

558
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
chi and certain societies. it was called

559
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
all kinds of um you know different ways

560
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
in different society but you find it all

561
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
around the world. uh they all knew there

562
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,720
was a field and and later on even in um

563
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,240
in modern physics later on um you know

564
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,080
at the turn of the 19th century and so

565
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,200
on it was called ether right there was

566
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,679
ether theory and um Maxwell wrote his

567
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,000
equation of

568
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,080
electromagnetics with an ether present

569
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
in his theory he was saying the

570
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,000
electromagnetic waves

571
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,880
traveling through an ether and so on.

572
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,360
And so to know that that is really there

573
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,320
and it's the source of the material

574
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
world and it connects us all because

575
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,919
we're all in this field is like

576
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,279
profound, right? Because all of a sudden

577
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,159
you're not isolated anymore. In fact,

578
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,679
nothing can be ever isolated

579
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,159
uh because it's always part of this

580
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,080
field and you are um in constant

581
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,679
information transfer with this field.

582
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,320
There's a constant emission of photons

583
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,919
and absorption of photons going on like

584
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,440
you're constantly thermal dynamically

585
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
burning, right? like your carnal engine

586
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,840
running at like 100 Fahrenheit, right,

587
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,640
for 80 years nonstop. And if it varies

588
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,039
by a few degrees, you're not having a

589
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,080
good day that day, right? And um you're

590
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,600
absorbing photons even through your

591
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,840
eyes, through you're absorbing

592
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,919
information through your senses and all

593
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,480
this, feeding it back. and to realize

594
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,080
you're part of this

595
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,240
incredible feed forward feedback

596
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,360
structure of spacetime that you're

597
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,240
participating in a collective that's

598
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,399
learning about itself. It really

599
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,320
transform your perspective on your

600
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,640
existence and your role in the universe.

601
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,039
It's it has profound meaning and it and

602
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,120
I could say much more about that but you

603
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
know like generally that's that's what

604
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,919
it's saying and then and your that your

605
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,120
nature is is is profound. You know

606
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,240
people think of themsel as one thing but

607
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
you're 100 trillion cell 50 to 100

608
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
trillion cell. It's non-trivial

609
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
complexity. There's like billions of

610
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
chemical change occurring every second

611
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,039
in your body. You're making a million

612
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,320
cells a sec second to replenish the ones

613
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
you're losing. Like you it's a dynamic

614
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,480
very energetic thing that you are and

615
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,799
that's only at the cellular level. Each

616
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,679
of one of those 100 trillion cell is

617
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,360
made of 100 trillion atoms. Okay, that's

618
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,919
at the atomic level. So like 100

619
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,559
trillion multiplied by 100 trillion is

620
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,520
the density of the atomic structure of

621
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
your existence that's highly coherent

622
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,480
and coordinated to make you right and

623
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,279
that's you know I mean I'm getting

624
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,279
philosophical here I just want to make

625
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,080
sure you're you're your listeners

626
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,559
understand I'm talking based on very

627
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,520
rigorous you know analytical

628
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,080
mathematical and physics uh equations.

629
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,039
Um, so I'm I'm I'm not saying this only

630
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,760
in the philosophical sense like there's

631
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,120
a real true and I'm I'm writing a bio

632
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
paper on this right now, bioysics paper

633
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,640
on this like there's a real true scaling

634
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,520
from this fundamental field into your

635
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,279
existence. That is the pulse. It's like

636
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,399
the fundamental pulse of creation

637
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:24,880
continuously creating this incredible

638
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,559
coherency and recreating it every second

639
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,120
because we we tend to think oh we are

640
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,399
one thing coherent and we think of it as

641
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,960
like some static thing like we were put

642
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,360
together and we we stayed together but

643
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,120
it's nothing static at all like in in a

644
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,200
few days you'll have replaced all your

645
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,520
skin and in a few weeks you'll have to

646
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,880
replace your bones and your you know um

647
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
and your organs and all this and you

648
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
know in a few months all of a sudden you

649
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,279
know you've made a new you right and

650
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,320
it's like so you're constantly redoing

651
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,080
this incredible coherent behavior. Um

652
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,120
and it's very specific to you. It's not

653
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
like you and me, we're both humans, but

654
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,720
we don't have the same irises and we

655
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
don't have the same digits and we don't,

656
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
you know, nothing is the same, right?

657
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,080
We're individual in the oneness of that

658
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,679
field because it fractalize to infinity.

659
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,840
And in the fractal, every point is the

660
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,480
center. So, you're not seeing the same

661
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
thing I'm seeing when we're looking at

662
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
this cup. You're seeing that side. I'm

663
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,279
saying this side. So we're feeding

664
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
different information to the field that

665
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
coheres us into existence. So the field

666
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,039
responds with a little bit different

667
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,320
information. And so that's why I'm a

668
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
little different than you. Right? So to

669
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,159
realize that like wow I'm actually

670
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,840
creating as I'm feeding into this field

671
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
and this feed field is feeding me back

672
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,799
um my experience in this world like to

673
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,799
realize I'm part of something that I can

674
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,159
engineer that I can get involved in and

675
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
transform. I think that's a lot of the

676
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
spiritual practice that you're talking

677
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,720
about. It's learning how to, you know,

678
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,159
interact with this field and manipulated

679
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,159
to like improve our condition.

680
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,440
Man, it really seems like from the

681
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,320
microscopic to the

682
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,760
macroscopic, the universe is having all

683
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
these unique perspectives and just like

684
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,480
through a Nassim and Andre experience like

685
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
we are unique perspectives of the

686
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,000
universe experiencing itself through our

687
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,519
eyes and um so so every individual every

688
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,840
point in the field is

689
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,320
infinitely important. It's it's giving

690
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,480
its own piece to the universe, right? So

691
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,960
that it can self-organize into very

692
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,200
advanced systems, very advanced complex

693
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,320
systems that were evidence of. So I mean

694
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
from the biological to the energetic

695
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,120
level, we see our inherent

696
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,039
interconnectedness that is very real.

697
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,960
It's not some spiritual new age woowoo

698
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
philosophical idea. It's an existential

699
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
reality of how life operates and reality

700
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,559
works. Mhm. Um, and you see the bees are

701
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
not on a planet that doesn't have

702
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,399
flowers, right? Like it's all

703
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,159
interdependent. Nature is completely

704
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,279
interdependent. And we are

705
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,480
interdependent. We don't really have a

706
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,799
choice.

707
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
Because I, you know, tend to think about

708
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,039
this a lot is like and to what degree

709
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,440
have I realize my own interconnectedness

710
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,480
and what in what aspect does my own ego

711
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,320
identity structure create separateness

712
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
between others which is the source of so

713
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,399
much suffering and I think we live in a

714
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,639
a society where the mythos of separation

715
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,040
is so deeply embedded that sees

716
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,119
individuals as completely separate

717
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
individuals and doesn't recognize that

718
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
interdependency that you were speaking

719
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,639
to. Yeah. You could even think of it

720
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,359
technically, you know, many of our laws

721
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,280
of conservation or laws of

722
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
thermodynamics starts with this

723
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,839
statement within a closed system. Da da

724
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,440
da da da da da. And it's useful for

725
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,760
engineering, okay, to like clo to assume

726
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,839
that the system is isolated from

727
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,159
everything else in the universe and so

728
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,719
that you can calculate you know its

729
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,159
energy and so on. However, if you forgot

730
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,918
that you made that closed system

731
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,839
artificially, now you have the

732
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,399
wrong your view of the dynamics of the

733
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,879
universe are a little bit tweaked,

734
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,160
right? Because if you look up isolated

735
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,960
system in any physics dictionary, it

736
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,520
should start if it's a good dictionary

737
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,599
with the first sentence saying no such

738
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,119
thing has ever been found. Right? No

739
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,520
system can be completely isolated from

740
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,880
gravitational fields, from

741
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,280
electromagnetic fields, right? You can't

742
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,359
isolate systems. All are parts of a

743
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,960
bigger hole in a way. And that that's

744
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,760
right. That's right. And one of those I

745
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,400
guess presumptions that we kind of just

746
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,040
put to the side is our idea of empty

747
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,359
space. And I would love because a lot of

748
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,200
the work that you're is is exploring

749
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,119
that empty space isn't actually empty,

750
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,800
you know, and our notion of the

751
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,119
conventional understanding of space as a

752
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,880
smooth continuum and like this empty

753
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
space. Um, I just love that you're

754
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
challenging it. And so I just want to

755
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
keep weaving in and out from the

756
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
philosophical understandings and how

757
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
this can be practical for people's

758
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,119
lives, but then also the science and

759
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,359
what you're doing here. So

760
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm challenging it, but I actually I'm

761
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,000
not. I I actually it's I'm just

762
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,599
reminding physicists that it was not

763
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,920
only predicted but measured in

764
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,079
laboratory and that it's necessary for

765
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,520
the foundation of quantum mechanics to

766
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,320
be consistent ma both mathematically and

767
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,800
conceptually in physics. You can't have

768
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
an oscillator that doesn't have a

769
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,040
source. And so this is this is very

770
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,400
straightforward and it doesn't come from

771
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,880
me. You

772
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,760
know, space is full of electromagnetic

773
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
fields

774
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,480
fluctuating with infinite amount of

775
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,200
energy or at least with energy all the

776
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,119
way to the plunk scale. Um which means

777
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,880
it has you and the PL scale is so fine

778
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
that the frequency is very very high

779
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
like if the wavelength is short then the

780
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,839
frequency is very high and so it's

781
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,240
incredible amount of energy at the plank

782
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,079
scale like a centimeter cube of space

783
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,359
has enough energy to that if I squish

784
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,240
the whole universe into that centimeter

785
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,320
cube of space like all the stars all the

786
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,359
galaxies, all the black holes,

787
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,760
everything into the imagine how bright

788
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,079
that thing would be. Okay, it would

789
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,280
still be 39 orders of magnitude not

790
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,440
dense

791
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,520
enough to describe the 0 point energy.

792
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,359
The 0 point energy is 10 to the 93 g per

793
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,040
cm cube. It's it's a huge density,

794
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,240
right? So it space is actually extremely

795
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,359
dense in electromagnetic fields.

796
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,160
And that's not a prediction I made. That

797
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,280
that is right from the foundation of

798
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
quantum

799
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,560
mechanics. So So how do you I guess how

800
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
do you relate to the empty the the the

801
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,839
space that is not so empty in between

802
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,320
the atoms in ourselves the the space

803
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,760
between our galaxies that is super vast.

804
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,640
So the error that was made is to to

805
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,760
ignore that field and now all you're

806
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,599
left with is the things that were in the

807
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,320
field. Now you only have the things. So

808
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,280
they're isolated and now you can't

809
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
realize that the things you're looking

810
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
at that you're talking that you're

811
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,240
calling particles like the protons in

812
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
the nucle of the atom or the atom itself

813
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
or the electron are actually dynamics of

814
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
that field. If you don't have the field

815
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,960
anymore then you don't know that what

816
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,119
you're looking at is just the dynamics

817
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,480
of that field. You see? So now you get

818
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,839
confused. you think that you're dealing

819
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,040
with like billiard balls when in fact

820
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,839
you're dealing with the field dynamic

821
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,200
and and that changes

822
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,000
everything. So it

823
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,240
really, you know, changes things when

824
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,040
you put the field back in and it starts

825
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,320
to actually make everything make sense.

826
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,760
And I mean makes sense mathematically

827
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,280
and you know it's describing properly

828
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
what you're measuring like the mass of

829
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,040
proton the standard model does not

830
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,280
describe properly where mass come from

831
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,839
right there's a Higs mechanism but the

832
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,520
Higs mechanism only predicts

833
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,200
5% of the mass of the proton 5%. Can you

834
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
unpack this a little bit more? How the

835
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,040
all the information from the whole

836
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
universe lies within a proton? Could you

837
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,880
explain that? Okay. Um, that gets a

838
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
little complicated, but I'm Let's

839
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,720
simplify it for for us. Yeah. For me as

840
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,480
a dumb monkey over here. Yes. Well,

841
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,400
that's okay. Um so

842
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,320
there's

843
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,400
evidence that um so there's these things

844
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,240
that are predicted by uh Einstein field

845
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,440
equation that are called

846
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,720
wormholes and um it's basically when

847
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,800
there's enough energy in a region of

848
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,800
spaceime can curve itself into little uh

849
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,280
tube that connects distant areas. you

850
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,359
know and uh almost

851
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,480
instantaneously. Okay. And these tubes

852
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,720
would be plunks size tube that connects

853
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,680
things. And in quantum physics, there's

854
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,839
this thing that we measure in laboratory

855
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,320
that particles can be

856
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,480
entangled, right? So that if you change

857
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
the state of this particle over there,

858
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,240
this one change instantaneously even if

859
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,000
it's on the other side of the universe,

860
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
if it's entangled.

861
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,880
And now we're starting to discover that

862
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,119
this entanglement that we measured in

863
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,520
laboratory maybe the the re the reason

864
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
for this entanglement is that it's

865
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,240
connected through

866
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,680
wormholes and that the particles might

867
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,359
act like mini black

868
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,680
holes. So that the hubs are black holes

869
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,839
and they are connected through wormholes

870
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,040
like a network like a neuronet network

871
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,880
where the server you know like a like a

872
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,760
internet network where the server is the

873
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,880
little black hole and the cables are the

874
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,839
wormholes. And so

875
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,599
um

876
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,599
strangely my equation

877
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,200
uh when I was kind of calculated the

878
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,240
number of bits of

879
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,079
information and so in physics there's a

880
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,800
relationship between energy mass E= M3²

881
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
there's as well a relationship between

882
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,760
mass or energy

883
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,280
and information.

884
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Okay. So where one plunk is a little one

885
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,839
bit of information if you'd like. And so

886
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,480
I was calculating the information

887
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,560
transfer that this little black hole

888
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,760
proton in the nuclear of the atom which

889
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,960
never decays. This little oscillator

890
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
seems to have an infinite source of

891
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,520
energy never decays. Well, I was trying

892
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,040
to figure out what is its relationship

893
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,520
to the rest. And when I calculated

894
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,640
this, I found that this the volume in

895
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,359
terms of little plunk structures in

896
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,640
terms of little bits of information has

897
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,359
all the information of the rest the

898
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,560
universe in it. Okay? Because it's

899
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,200
connected through the little wormhole to

900
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,280
the whole rest of the universe. You're

901
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,720
able to calculate the mass of the

902
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
universe within the single proton within

903
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,079
a single proton. And when we use

904
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,400
standard equation to calculate the rest

905
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,119
of the the mass of the universe, we end

906
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,400
up with 4.9% the mass of the universe.

907
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,040
The rest we have to invent in dark

908
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,960
matter and dark energy.

909
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,040
96% of the mass the universe we have to

910
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,400
put it in as a fudge factor because the

911
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
but in this case when you do it with the

912
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,880
proton like that you get the exact

913
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,119
density of the universe. get the exact

914
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,119
mass, not needing to do any fudging. You

915
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,680
get the mindblowing. It's mind-blowing

916
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,920
because you're studying a teeny little

917
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,119
teeny thing inside the atom like it's so

918
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,000
small and you get answers about the

919
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,440
nature of the universe. Can you give us

920
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,359
an understanding of how small like a

921
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,480
proton is in terms of Yeah. So, so like

922
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,560
I was saying, you're like cells are

923
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,440
already small cuz you made a 50 to

924
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,240
100,000 cell trillion a trillion cell.

925
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,280
Yeah, that that's a lot of cell, right?

926
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
Like so they're already small and each

927
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,800
cell is made of 100 trillion atom. So

928
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,359
that's small. Okay. And then if you take

929
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,839
an atom and you say, okay, the atom size

930
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,400
is the electron cloud, right?

931
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,040
Well, if the electron cloud was the size

932
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,079
of the dome at the Vatican, then the

933
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,599
proton would be the head of a pin in the

934
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,040
middle. Okay? So, the atom is

935
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,000
99.9999% space and that space is full of

936
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,319
electromagnetic fluctuation. And the

937
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,680
little proton in the middle, you can't

938
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,560
say it's a billiard ball when you do the

939
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,000
physics of it. It's it's all you can say

940
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
is that in that region of space there's

941
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,960
a really high energy density. Okay. That

942
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,440
you're describing as a particle, but

943
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,920
it's not like a billiard ball. Right.

944
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,760
Right. It's not necessarily physical and

945
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,160
how we would describe it. That's right.

946
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,920
When you're looking at the physics of

947
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,920
physicality, you find that there's no

948
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,319
real physical Yeah. It's not really

949
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,040
physical. It's all field interaction.

950
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,160
Yeah, it's all exchange. It's all ratio

951
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,280
of exchange of information. And so it's

952
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
it's remarkable. It's mindblowing. Like

953
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,800
you have I would have to run you through

954
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,960
a lot of equation and we would be here

955
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,599
forever. But there's many moments in

956
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,760
these equations when I would run you

957
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,480
through your brain would just splatter

958
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,200
on the walls because it's like wa it's

959
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,920
so incredible. Like one of the things I

960
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,240
made I calculate I figured out this

961
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,240
ratio right of the scaling from this

962
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,280
plunk field from the what I call the PL

963
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,400
plasma. So it's a plasma where the

964
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,280
particles of the plasma is the plunk

965
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,040
size oscillators right and I calculated

966
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,680
like so if it's making wormholes of

967
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,800
plunk size connecting things then the

968
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,119
stuff that's going through the wormholes

969
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,160
has to be smaller than the plunk size.

970
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,480
So I which how yeah how how is that even

971
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,160
possible right because isn't pl the

972
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,720
plunk size you then you have to go super

973
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,200
luminous right the plank size they find

974
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,079
the speed you have to go you got to go

975
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,319
super luminous because you're inside the

976
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,160
black hole right and so so I calculated

977
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,640
because now I know the scaling so I was

978
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,160
able to calculate that so I was able to

979
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,880
calculate how fast the information is

980
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,960
moving and entangling all the particles.

981
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,880
So we say in quantum physics it's

982
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,280
instantaneous the entanglement but

983
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,240
that's just because it's so fast

984
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,280
that we can't measure it. Right? So it's

985
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,040
actually not instantaneous. It's just

986
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,240
really fast. No. And and if the universe

987
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,359
was connected that way and the refresh

988
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,680
rate was at the speed of light, the

989
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,079
universe would fall apart because it

990
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,000
would take billions of years for

991
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,079
information to go from one side of the

992
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,800
universe to the other. The univer the

993
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,880
states of every particle in the universe

994
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,040
must be known so that all the other

995
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,920
particles can be in the appropriate

996
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,839
relationship of states. Right? So at the

997
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,400
speed of light it cannot happen but at

998
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,480
the speed. So I calculate at the speed

999
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,800
of the

1000
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,880
subplon how fast would a bit of

1001
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,280
information go from this side of the

1002
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,200
universe to the other side of the

1003
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
universe. So it has to do with the size

1004
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,839
of the universe and the speed of the s

1005
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,560
block as it goes through the network of

1006
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,119
all the protons. Right? So I calculated

1007
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,560
that and it give me 10 to the minus 23

1008
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,319
seconds to go from one side of the

1009
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,590
universe

1010
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,839
[Music]

1011
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:09,760
like000023 zeros of a second right it's

1012
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,440
super fast right to go across the

1013
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,520
universe and that just okay this is the

1014
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,760
part where my brain just got splattered

1015
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,040
all over the wall that I recognized that

1016
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,359
number when I saw that number. It just

1017
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,240
happens to be exactly how long it takes

1018
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,920
one proton to do one turn.

1019
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,079
Damn. For the oscillator to do every

1020
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,520
time the oscillator does one turn, the

1021
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,319
universe has been updated about the

1022
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,480
state of all the other one complete

1023
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,319
spin. One complete spin. All the rest of

1024
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,160
the oscillators in the universe has

1025
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,359
been, you know, updated on the state of

1026
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,160
that and and so everything is

1027
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,800
continuously in relationship that way.

1028
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,200
And it's like you start to see it's like

1029
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,079
gear ratios. Yeah. You know, it's like

1030
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,040
gears structuring the structure of space

1031
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,760
but in a completely nonlinear way. So,

1032
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,280
I'm curious what you think about this

1033
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
because obviously that's incredibly

1034
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,640
mind-blowing. And if we're all made of

1035
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,400
the same thing the universe is made out

1036
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,000
of, I'm curious about what your thoughts

1037
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,079
are having access to non-local

1038
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,920
information and allowing knowledge to

1039
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,319
emerge from within us. Like the hermetic

1040
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,240
principle of as above so below, as

1041
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,480
within so without. Exactly. it kind of

1042
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,319
points to this that all starts to make

1043
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,280
sense but very

1044
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,720
rigorously you know when it's no longer

1045
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,359
a philosophy when it's rigorous then

1046
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,480
it's really giving you all the details

1047
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,880
the mechanics on how it works is very

1048
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,000
very powerful as well for engineering

1049
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,319
because now you can make you know warp

1050
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,440
drives you can make energy anywhere you

1051
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,960
are you know go to Jupiter for the

1052
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,880
weekend like go to Jupiter for the

1053
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,040
weekend will change your consciousness

1054
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,160
very romantic

1055
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,720
No, it's powerful, you know, as well.

1056
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,720
Yeah.

1057
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,880
Yeah. I mean, you know, looking at Earth

1058
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,599
in your bedroom, you know, from Jupiter

1059
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,359
would be a nice, you know, sea uh scenic

1060
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,839
view. And it and so or you can levitate

1061
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:21,200
your you know your habitat you know just

1062
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,280
at the right uh sro uh orbit so that you

1063
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,040
have sunset in your living room all the

1064
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,200
time you know or sunrise or and

1065
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,280
so all of a

1066
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,319
sudden you know society changed

1067
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,520
dramatically but yeah like you were

1068
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,559
saying like the these ancient principle

1069
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,800
that since we're made out of that stuff.

1070
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,599
It might have emerged instinctively from

1071
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,760
us. Never mind that the ancients told

1072
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,680
the world in all of their cultures. We

1073
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,480
didn't came up with

1074
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,559
this. People that came from the stars

1075
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
came and told us this. You know, sun

1076
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,359
gods that came from the universe.

1077
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,520
Serious be from all over. Yeah. From all

1078
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,240
over. The Doon tribe. like all these

1079
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,559
amazing, incredible ancient traditions

1080
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,160
and societies that had access to

1081
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,760
information that they poss they couldn't

1082
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,359
have possibly come up with at the time.

1083
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,559
Exactly. They knew that Sirrus was a a

1084
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,720
binary star system. They knew that

1085
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,480
Sirrus B was like the heaviest material

1086
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,440
in like you know which is which is true,

1087
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,400
you know, white dough and you know like

1088
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,920
s like they knew the orbit of Sirius B

1089
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,800
around Sirrus A. I mean it is like all

1090
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,760
these things is is remarkable. There's

1091
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,720
no way we discovered this when we got

1092
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,800
telescopes big enough um you know way

1093
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,599
later. U so I mean there's a couple

1094
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,119
perspectives of like how that could be

1095
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,119
possible. One is that there is you know

1096
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,319
a previous ancient civilization that had

1097
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,520
contact with alien beings or whatever.

1098
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,440
But also on on on we were just talking

1099
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,359
about if we have access to non-local

1100
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,680
information and the whole like you can

1101
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,920
calculate the acceleration and density

1102
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,760
of the universe within a single proton

1103
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,800
and we have we're made up of protons you

1104
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,240
know then I'm just curious like what how

1105
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,319
does this change our notion of human

1106
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,319
potential as these discoveries and

1107
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,280
you're making them scientifically uh

1108
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,400
rigorous what does it mean and what

1109
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,839
potential implications does it have as

1110
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,240
to who we are and like what what we are

1111
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,839
as human beings

1112
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,319
Well, you know, you might start to

1113
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,480
consider that even the the seat of your

1114
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,880
consciousness is actually coming from

1115
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,720
that

1116
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,839
source, right? That um

1117
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,640
that your knowledge and your creativity

1118
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,680
is actually emerging from that inner

1119
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,760
knowing, right? That inner knowing. And

1120
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,520
if you look at the greatest scientists

1121
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,520
or sculptors or you know artists and so

1122
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,680
on around the world in

1123
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,240
history most of them said it was from

1124
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,960
within. I had like a gut feeling and

1125
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,760
maybe a scientist like went after and

1126
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,240
tried to figure out the math for it but

1127
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,680
they had the concept first. If you want

1128
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,559
to know the future, you look at, you

1129
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,200
know, science fiction's movie because,

1130
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
you know, all the technology we have

1131
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,240
today was in science fiction not so long

1132
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,160
ago, right? the cell phone, the

1133
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,359
refrigerator, the you know the the

1134
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:40,640
submarines, all this was like

1135
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,119
everything, the planes, the rockets, it

1136
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,839
was all in our inner knowing first and

1137
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,559
then we figured out how to do make it in

1138
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,079
the real world. So where is that coming

1139
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,680
from? Right? it it so so yeah I I truly

1140
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,760
believe that because the proton is

1141
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,280
entangled that particles that make up

1142
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,480
your body are entangled to all of the

1143
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,520
rest of the universe you have access to

1144
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,119
infinite amount of information right and

1145
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,400
I I think the the master that walked the

1146
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,880
earth that told people go within if you

1147
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,760
want to access the kingdom of heaven

1148
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,880
I think they were really mean a heaven

1149
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,480
like the the universe is and they said

1150
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,079
it in many case is within you and I

1151
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,920
think they really meant it like

1152
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
physically. The problem is the

1153
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,599
tendencies to uh extrapolate these

1154
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,400
notions to philosophy and try to

1155
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,599
actually separate from the material

1156
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,559
world in

1157
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,319
spirituality and see like some

1158
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,720
separation where what I'm finding is

1159
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,079
that no no the material world is the

1160
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,680
source right so you you have to

1161
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,160
integrate within And within the material

1162
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,960
world you have the tunnel to infinite

1163
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,280
amount of energy, infinite amount of

1164
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,640
knowledge. I mean you look at some of

1165
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,599
the greatest minds that have lived from

1166
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,160
Nicola Tesla to Kurt God to

1167
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,559
um Einstein to Isaac Newton. A lot of

1168
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,800
them spent just as much time in their

1169
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,359
metaphysical practice of alchemy um that

1170
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,960
they wrote many papers about and in

1171
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,040
their journals about about accessing

1172
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,640
that empty space within them and finding

1173
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,400
emptiness and going within and finding

1174
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,960
the kingdom of heaven. They found a lot

1175
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,599
of them spoke to how their novel

1176
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,440
discoveries came by virtue of of course

1177
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
doing the work studying your physics

1178
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,280
doing doing that and then forgetting it

1179
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
all going into the silence and seeing

1180
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,119
what wants to emerge from within you.

1181
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,839
And it seems as though the more that we

1182
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,559
make space for that silence and to find

1183
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,040
stillness within ourselves, whether

1184
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,680
we're a physicists at the forefront of

1185
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,680
novel discovery in that world or um we

1186
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,079
have a podcast or we're an author and

1187
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,799
we're writing like there is an emergent

1188
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,880
new version of what wants to come

1189
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,799
through us. I feel all that we can tap

1190
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,480
into. And I just would love for you to

1191
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,280
continue to speak to that because it

1192
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,040
opens up so many doors and it's a theme

1193
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,319
we've explored many times in this

1194
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,640
podcast. By accessing kind of that zero

1195
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,960
point and and finding stillness within

1196
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,319
you, you gain access to something really

1197
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,000
incredible that is greater than you

1198
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,839
possibly could have intellectually

1199
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,559
conceived of. Yeah, of course. Because

1200
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,280
like if you if you access this all of a

1201
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,400
sudden you realize the infinite nature

1202
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,640
of your existence, you know, the

1203
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,760
incredible potential that you hold. um

1204
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,720
and the capacity to tap into sets of

1205
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,960
information that you know there's a

1206
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,599
reason why like oh you know we did

1207
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,599
studies on remote viewing and 80% of you

1208
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,040
know they were blocking students off

1209
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,839
Berkeley you know um university like

1210
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,440
right out of you know the the the during

1211
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,359
lunch and without training trying to get

1212
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,920
them to remote view a place they never

1213
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,000
been to and they got like something like

1214
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,640
80% success and things like that and

1215
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,520
like you know like how is that possible

1216
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,240
because the whole thing is entangled and

1217
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,720
the information is there and it actually

1218
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,359
doesn't take very much training to

1219
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,839
actually have access to it and the fact

1220
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,119
that you're conscious right

1221
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:48,240
now maybe because this is exactly the

1222
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,520
evidence of the access of to this

1223
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,760
information. your consciousness is

1224
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,200
actually the feedback in the field of

1225
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
this information and so you know it it

1226
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,599
starts to it starts to match really

1227
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:07,599
nicely. The difference is that if you

1228
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,319
have a rigorous mechanical understanding

1229
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,440
of it, you're going to be able to make

1230
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,760
it into your

1231
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,960
technology. you know, you're going to be

1232
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,760
able to like apply it into your

1233
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,319
technology. Now, imagine that you have

1234
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,880
technology that now is able to

1235
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,079
like extract, you know, that information

1236
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,240
in the material world. Um now it's

1237
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,240
producing power just by sitting there uh

1238
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,760
tapping in that same field that nature

1239
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,920
is doing every moment. You know, in in

1240
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,319
it's common for physicists to tell

1241
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,319
people

1242
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,720
uh and especially inventors that are

1243
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,400
working on these technologies that it

1244
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,359
violates the laws of thermodynamics and

1245
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,000
you can't do this and there's no there's

1246
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,319
no free lunch and you know when is last

1247
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,640
time the universe send you a build for

1248
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,040
the energy of all your atoms, right?

1249
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,880
Like but that as well that like you

1250
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,920
are there's no perpetual

1251
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,480
motion right

1252
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,000
but find me something that's not

1253
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,440
perpetual then okay actually there's

1254
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,359
only perpetual motion we have been

1255
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,559
looking at protons all the way back as

1256
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,359
far as we can see we don't see one

1257
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,160
proton decay we protons don't decay they

1258
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,480
perpetually continue to oscillate and be

1259
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,680
their nice proton nature, right? And

1260
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,640
produce a charge and all this stuff. And

1261
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,040
that's

1262
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,559
remarkable. Okay. And and so, you know,

1263
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,280
it's like another perspective. Oh, it's

1264
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,760
like it's like a change of perspective

1265
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,480
from a perspective of of lack. There's,

1266
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,359
you know, uh entropy. Everything goes to

1267
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,359
the shits, you know, eventually to Oh,

1268
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,079
if there's disorder is because there was

1269
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,240
order before. So, there's a cycle of

1270
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,839
order centropy going the other way.

1271
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:26,720
Exactly. And I can hook my technology. I

1272
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,440
can hook my consciousness and my

1273
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,799
technology to this natural cycle. And

1274
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,119
all of a sudden I have a society that

1275
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,559
has infinite amount of energy that can

1276
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,200
travel through the solar system if not

1277
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,440
the galaxy or even the universe. And and

1278
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,520
you know it just changes the whole game.

1279
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,880
You realize you're not isolated and

1280
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,240
you're part of an energy dynamic that

1281
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,520
you can tap into it and use to infinity.

1282
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,160
You know, it's like when you tap into

1283
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,280
the energy of a lake that has water

1284
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,160
going down through a turbine, right? A

1285
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,119
hydroelectric dam, right? You didn't put

1286
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,760
the water in the lake. You did. And the

1287
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,280
water falls through the turbine. It's

1288
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,680
called a gravitational potential. It

1289
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,520
falls into the turbine and you extract

1290
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,680
energy. And you calculate the entropy or

1291
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,960
you calculate the inefficiency of your

1292
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,839
turbine and you say you see it's not

1293
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:41,440
over unity. It's you know I I I'm not

1294
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,599
able

1295
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,920
to remove all the gravitational

1296
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,119
potential. is some disorder, right? The

1297
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,880
the water doesn't turn the propella

1298
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,599
exactly perfectly,

1299
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:57,520
right? But that's because you've made a

1300
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,720
box and isolated the system. Yeah. The

1301
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,359
lake, the water going down the dam and

1302
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,440
going out and you cut the box there. But

1303
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,599
that's not the the universe doesn't have

1304
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,440
that box. the universe. So blow the box

1305
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,240
away and then follow the water and the f

1306
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,640
because the earth is spinning because

1307
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,440
the sun is shining because their

1308
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,599
corololis forces the water is

1309
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,040
evaporating and it's making clouds and

1310
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,760
the clouds are going back north, right?

1311
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,200
And they're raining back into your lake,

1312
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,319
right? That's the centropy cycle, right?

1313
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,520
That closes the loop. And so this is

1314
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,160
continuously happening and your little

1315
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,960
turbine it is over unity. You're

1316
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,680
extracting energy from the universe. It

1317
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,559
gave it to you. Right? Same thing in

1318
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,680
nuclear fision. You know the energy that

1319
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,920
is in the nuclei. You didn't put it

1320
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,880
there. You're just extracting energy

1321
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,440
that's already been put there by the

1322
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,839
universe. So this is just a way to

1323
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,319
realize, oh actually I don't have to

1324
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,319
extract the energy after it's made

1325
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,000
atoms. I can tap into the source of

1326
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,200
energy that makes the

1327
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,440
atom and and instead of breaking things

1328
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,319
apart and doing all this, you know, high

1329
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:25,200
energy I physics and and you know,

1330
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,680
trying to fuse atoms or instead of like

1331
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,799
like doing like crazy huge device that

1332
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,280
cost billions of dollars, I can just

1333
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,559
tickle the field. I can do you know yeah

1334
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,319
I can do just like you know harmonic

1335
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,640
coupling to the field I can like play I

1336
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,880
can dance with the field I can make a

1337
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,480
little gradient of my own right over in

1338
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,280
theory right in theory and in practice

1339
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,599
is it it was done it was done it was

1340
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,680
done meaning accessing that infinite

1341
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,000
energy within a single point how how was

1342
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,319
it done it was done by many inventors

1343
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,680
throughout the ages

1344
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,720
throughout like Tesla and the Mor

1345
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,359
brothers before Tesla and so on and many

1346
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,359
other inventors. Why is that not

1347
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,079
obviously and I I could come up with my

1348
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,400
reasons why but why why is that not

1349
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,039
publicly known? Why is that not more of

1350
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,400
an Steven Gre did a good movie the last

1351
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,400
century that you can find on uh Amazon.

1352
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,079
I think it's really a good historical

1353
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,799
uh documentary of all the inventors and

1354
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,960
what happened to them. Let's just say

1355
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,079
there's not been so much excitement

1356
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,520
about bringing these type of

1357
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,480
technologies to u the public and to the

1358
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,520
market throughout the ages uh throughout

1359
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,119
the the the last few decades. And I

1360
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,400
don't I don't really don't think that

1361
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,839
should surprise anybody with the

1362
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,079
understanding of I mean just like the

1363
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,760
pharmaceutical industry is they profit

1364
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,680
off of keeping customers it's kind of a

1365
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,920
sad reality that they don't as much by

1366
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,480
creating cures right and similarly the

1367
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,760
energy crisis right

1368
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,839
um it's a trillion dollar industry right

1369
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,000
so there's a lot of people that want to

1370
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,680
protect that well and you know I think

1371
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,119
when you look at 0 point energy history

1372
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,680
and you rigorously, it's hard to believe

1373
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,119
that it was missed that badly. You you

1374
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,200
you start to suspect that on purpose. I

1375
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,319
don't know if you saw the the

1376
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:45,119
the movie Oenheimer, you know. Um so,

1377
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,680
you know, they they showed the history

1378
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,400
of the development of the bomb of the

1379
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,520
atomic bomb. And at one point I was

1380
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,760
really proud of them. They say you know

1381
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,480
we we are going to extract the energy of

1382
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,480
the strong force. This is the force

1383
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,760
that's holding things together. Um but

1384
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,520
you

1385
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,119
know

1386
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:11,160
basically it really is that like at the

1387
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,760
time you start to suspect that they on

1388
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,599
purpose

1389
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,960
derailed away from zero point energy for

1390
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,880
reasons that had some value at the time.

1391
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,280
you know, we were talking the end of the

1392
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,920
Second World War or, you know, the

1393
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,000
middle of the Second World War and like

1394
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,480
all kinds of issue uh with like racing

1395
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,640
to make a bomb. um

1396
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,880
giving equations and understanding of

1397
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,280
physics that says there's an infinite

1398
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,319
amount of energy in the nuclear of the

1399
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:54,559
atom that could be tapped into was maybe

1400
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,119
not, you know, the thing they wanted to

1401
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,960
do to give to the enemies um at the

1402
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,680
time, you know, whether you're on one

1403
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,280
side or another. And

1404
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,079
so it might have got derailed for those

1405
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,480
reasons, security reasons at the time,

1406
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,960
right? And then maybe it kept on being

1407
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,400
derailed. Um and and how would you do

1408
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,880
that? You just you have control over

1409
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,400
what's being taught in the you know uh

1410
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,119
academic structures. So you just train

1411
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,280
your

1412
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,640
physicist and you remove you confuse

1413
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,400
them and you remove that part of the

1414
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,280
equations. So see many people in the

1415
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
scientific community I think just one

1416
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,240
thing you do that and you convince them

1417
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,440
to continue to repeat that it's

1418
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,640
impossible even if it's there it's

1419
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,799
impossible to extract energy from it.

1420
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,079
you you continue to repeat that right

1421
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,440
where in fact the equation tells you as

1422
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,720
we demonstrate I mean the mainstream

1423
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,720
didn't have the fact that it produced

1424
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,640
mass but it clearly tells you that the

1425
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,359
oscillator is needing that energy to

1426
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,960
keep oscillating and and we prove that

1427
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,238
it's actually the source of mass. So, so

1428
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,679
it's all of reality is evidence that

1429
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,600
it's extracting that energy, right? And

1430
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,040
you have the kasmir effect which is like

1431
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,520
two plates that get pushed together by

1432
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,600
the vacuum fluctuation because you

1433
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,359
eliminate the long wavelength between

1434
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:36,640
the two plates. You make a little

1435
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,040
gradient and the plates get pushed. It's

1436
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,439
a little pressure. It's not much, but

1437
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,759
it's still energy. You're extracting for

1438
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,799
to to continue saying you can't extract

1439
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,080
energy from it is kind of ridiculous. We

1440
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,719
we know for instance that it's producing

1441
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,520
the spontaneous emission of photons and

1442
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,799
nuclei and and so on. So it really like

1443
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,040
it's it's it's really much more evidence

1444
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,319
that it is at the source of the material

1445
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,359
world than that it's a weird animal and

1446
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,759
you can ignore it because it all cancels

1447
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,759
out and you can't get any energy from

1448
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,238
it. A quick share when it comes to

1449
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,399
health I feel it's a lot of the little

1450
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,040
things that add up and for me one of

1451
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,960
those little things is starting my day

1452
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,560
with AG1. AG1 is a foundational

1453
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,719
nutrition supplement that delivers daily

1454
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,960
nutrients and gut health support. And

1455
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,399
it's backed by multiple research

1456
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,000
studies, so you can trust what you're

1457
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,158
putting in your body. Unlike so many

1458
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,319
other products, their entire formula is

1459
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,319
backed by research studies and not just

1460
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,560
the ingredients. And they've conducted a

1461
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,238
study with the key markers of

1462
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,839
highquality research, which is

1463
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,399
third-party, double blind, and placeboc

1464
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,000
controlled. The results from their

1465
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,439
published studies are aligned with what

1466
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,199
I've also personally noticed. For

1467
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,840
example, in one study, after 30 days,

1468
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,480
97% of people felt more energy. And in

1469
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,360
another, after 90 days, 97% felt their

1470
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,840
digestion improve. So, start with AG1

1471
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,360
and notice the difference for yourself.

1472
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,120
It's a great first step to investing in

1473
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,719
your health. And that's why I'm so

1474
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,880
excited to be partnering with them. Try

1475
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,159
AG1 and get a free bottle of vitamin D3,

1476
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,960
K2, and five free AG1 travel packs with

1477
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,320

1481
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,880
out. Link in the description as always.

1482
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,600
Back to the show. I think many within

1483
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,040
the scientific community like I would

1484
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,320
just want to ask you because I've

1485
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,800
actually met people who or met someone

1486
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,480
who's said that they've created a free

1487
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,080
energy device and there's many people

1488
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,480
out there to to what degree you think

1489
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,239
they have legitimacy or whatever is up

1490
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,520
for debate. I think there's probably a

1491
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,600
lot of cooks out there also. There's a

1492
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,440
lot of goofy stuff and in many case it's

1493
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,560
people that instinctively trying to do

1494
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,239
it and in many case they don't

1495
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:02,800
necessarily are trying to mislead

1496
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,920
people. They just confuse about how they

1497
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,679
should make measurements and all this.

1498
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,120
They don't have enough technical

1499
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,960
knowledge to do it properly. So you have

1500
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,560
personally seen like a free energy

1501
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,560
device in person. But there is some Yes.

1502
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,719
that are that I personally verified that

1503
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,360
you know it gets pretty easy when the

1504
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,320
device has no input

1505
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,000
power you know so device that have input

1506
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,480
power it gets harder but but when they

1507
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,040
have zero input power and they

1508
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,440
continuously output power like what's an

1509
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,960
example of a device that would do

1510
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,679
something like that with no input

1511
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:42,480
power like what what would using water

1512
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,040
how like hooking up to wire uh no many

1513
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,159
of them that like that or a static

1514
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,000
device. There's nothing moving, just

1515
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,600
something on a countertop, a device

1516
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,280
that's pulling energy from the zero

1517
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,360
point, right? It's got a bunch of coils

1518
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,120
and they're oscillating and they're

1519
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,040
creating harmonic relationships

1520
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,679
together. They basically spinning the

1521
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,760
structure of spaceime a little bit in

1522
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,239
the region of space and extracting a

1523
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,920
little energy. It's making its own

1524
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,320
little smoothie, its own little, you

1525
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,239
know, gradient.

1526
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,679
If you if you've seen something like

1527
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,679
this and it's it actually exists out

1528
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,159
there, why I feel like it wouldn't be

1529
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,640
that hard to have somebody with this

1530
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,760
device and to verify its legitimacy on a

1531
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,440
platform where it's seen by millions of

1532
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,800
people and completely shift the

1533
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,320
scientific paradigm understanding of

1534
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,679
energy. It seems so. It seems so. Right.

1535
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,560
So like I uh I would refer you back to

1536
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,159
what we saw happen. Yeah. In the last

1537
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:43,239
few years in relationship

1538
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:47,000
to some you know

1539
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,520
strange you know virus

1540
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,400
that you know emerged supposedly because

1541
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,520
somebody ate a bat. Uhhuh. Okay. Yeah.

1542
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,080
So what was what do you think when I saw

1543
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,360
that I was like holding my head with my

1544
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,000
two hands thinking okay but I've studied

1545
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,440
a lot of biopysics I'm not an expert in

1546
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,080
biology I call my viologist friends and

1547
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,080
I ask you know can you get source 2 from

1548
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,280
eating a bat you know because viruses

1549
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,520
that don't infect human cells don't just

1550
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,080
all of a sudden decide to infect them.

1551
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,760
So what would you think is the most

1552
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,960
likely possibility? Some miracle that

1553
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,920
SARS 2 all of a sudden decided to infect

1554
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,040
human cells because somebody ate a bat.

1555
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,760
I guess it was undercooked or something.

1556
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,719
or down the street, the P4

1557
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:53,640
lab that was working on gain of function

1558
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,520
research, publishing papers of how use

1559
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,320
to use, you know, SARS to to um you know

1560
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,159
and and and and change it so that it

1561
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,120
would be able to infect human cells.

1562
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,239
Which one like which one you think is

1563
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,440
the highest probability? you know how

1564
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,159
long it took to like and it's still

1565
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,800
today there's debate about it. You know,

1566
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,280
I could get in trouble. I'm hoping I'm

1567
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,400
not getting your channel in trouble. No,

1568
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,080
I mean I think it's a very it's a thing

1569
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,719
that um is actually like legitimately

1570
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,960
being considered on both on both sides.

1571
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,000
Like it's Yes. And I would just suggest

1572
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,040
that the probabilities are high. Yeah.

1573
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,679
that the P4 lab that's working on that

1574
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,640
is the source of this thing. So you see

1575
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,159
it's

1576
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,000
if you have enough

1577
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,960
resources to stop certain sets of

1578
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,280
information from getting into the world.

1579
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,640
And on the other side, you have

1580
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,040
inventors that have zero resources that

1581
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,920
are putting things together with, you

1582
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,920
know, barb wire and duct tape and

1583
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,239
plywood, right? Um, it's pretty easy to

1584
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,320
convince the rest of the scientific

1585
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,239
community they're all qu, right? and in

1586
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,480
the quote, you know, in the like

1587
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,360
dismissal of them and then you miss the

1588
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,199
jewels, right, in in the in the system.

1589
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,560
Well, I'm excited to talk to you more

1590
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,239
off air about this and you know, I don't

1591
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,360
want to get too much into the weeds

1592
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,560
because there's a lot of I still want to

1593
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,280
talk about, but um Yeah. And I it'll get

1594
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,679
me in trouble. I'm already in trouble.

1595
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,159
No, we got to keep you safe. Yes. Well,

1596
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,480
we'll try.

1597
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,320
I also just want to go back because we

1598
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,840
referenced a lot of things that I would

1599
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,560
like to touch on.

1600
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,520
One, we live in a scientific world, a

1601
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,600
cartisian way of kind of putting things

1602
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,719
in conceptual boxes where the material

1603
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,840
reductionists have really divorced from

1604
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,000
having intrinsic kind of spiritual

1605
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,520
experiences where they feel their

1606
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,560
interconnectedness. You know, I think if

1607
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,199
a lot of these materialists had maybe an

1608
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,640
experience with a psychedelic or a

1609
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,400
meditative experience, they they might

1610
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,199
be open to considering these other

1611
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:25,760
realities. Um, I've experienced, you

1612
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,760
know, uh, like like you were mentioning

1613
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,159
with the remote viewing. Um, I think

1614
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,760
when you have either an internal

1615
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,080
experience or you really validate

1616
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,400
through like this one time, however it

1617
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,400
sounds, I had a call with a psychic.

1618
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,679
Okay, say what you want about psychics.

1619
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,840
They that girl said to me things that

1620
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,640
nobody like would could possibly know.

1621
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,520
Okay. And so to me because you have

1622
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,480
access to all information, right? But

1623
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,880
she wouldn't have physical access on the

1624
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,800
web or talking to people like there's

1625
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,280
just no way. And so she must have access

1626
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,679
to connection to the web to some degree.

1627
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,679
So putting all of that to the universal

1628
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,760
web, right? Yeah. Yeah. The universal

1629
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,080
web, not www. Um, so putting put with

1630
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,800
all that being said, I want to explore

1631
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,719
your understanding of the nature of

1632
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,880
consciousness because we've been having

1633
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
more conversations on recently this show

1634
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,760
around uh exploring pansychism,

1635
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,480
idealism, different types of monism and

1636
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,960
understanding what is the nature of of

1637
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,640
consciousness and how it plays with

1638
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,719
everything that we're speaking to. And

1639
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,280
so we talked about how the information

1640
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,239
of the whole is within the part. We are

1641
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,560
a conscious being that has awareness of

1642
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,800
itself and can access these different

1643
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,280
information points on the web so to

1644
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,280
speak. So what do you think is the

1645
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,679
nature of consciousness? Um do you

1646
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,360
believe it's a fundamental constituent

1647
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,400
of the

1648
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,520
universe? Yeah. You know this it's funny

1649
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,880
like 30 years ago when I was starting to

1650
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,920
present in physics conferences

1651
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,679
um it was you could you could say the f

1652
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,840
word but you could not say the c word

1653
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,120
like you couldn't talk about

1654
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,040
consciousness. It was thought to be

1655
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,880
unscientific to talk about

1656
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,600
consciousness. No no no physicist that

1657
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,239
was a respectable physicist was talking

1658
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,400
about consciousness. And now it's kind

1659
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,520
of flipped on its head. And um you know

1660
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,000
it's it's kind of the cool thing for

1661
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,640
physicists to talk about consciousness

1662
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,600
and to explore where consciousness is

1663
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,360
coming from and and all this. And so you

1664
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,199
get all these statements coming out even

1665
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:43,120
from the mouth of physicists uh saying

1666
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,679
you know I believe that consciousness is

1667
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,960
the source of everything and then like

1668
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,239
everything emerged from

1669
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,760
consciousness and I'm really not a big

1670
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,640
proponent of these uh

1671
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,159
theories

1672
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:03,040
because they are replacing the word god

1673
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,679
with consciousness. or the word big bang

1674
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,080
with consciousness, right? It's like,

1675
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,239
oh, it l came out of consciousness, but

1676
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,320
what is that, right? What is

1677
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,719
consciousness? If you're not giving me

1678
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,520
the mechanics of how consciousness made

1679
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,239
all the atoms, then I'm, you know, I'm

1680
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,199
I'm I'm not more advanced than some

1681
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,640
cult, right? So, so I I'm not interested

1682
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,760
in these type of statements. Um, if

1683
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,000
you're going to say consciousness, then

1684
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,520
you better define what that is. And and

1685
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,920
in the context of this field of

1686
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,600
information that's creating coherency

1687
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,320
um and scaling from this fundamental

1688
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,360
pulse up the pulses to eventually the

1689
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,440
frequency of for instance the

1690
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,400
microtubules in the brain. And I I just

1691
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,239
finished that part. It's unpublished.

1692
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,880
It's very exciting. It gives all the

1693
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,280
right answers for like the carbon atom,

1694
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,080
the benzin ring and like the microtubule

1695
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,320
and all this. And so if that's true,

1696
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,719
then

1697
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,520
consciousness is is an

1698
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,560
emergent like what we call human

1699
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,080
consciousness is actually an emergent

1700
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,520
phenomena at the end of the feedback

1701
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,640
loop of information. You know because

1702
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,920
conscious being aware and so I I'd

1703
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,960
rather use the word awareness than

1704
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,840
consciousness being aware of yourself

1705
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,120
means that you have understood the

1706
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,360
feedback that you're seeing in the

1707
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,320
mirror for instance that that is you

1708
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,159
right so you're aware of self right now

1709
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:51,719
that I believe is the you know like uh

1710
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:54,000
ultimate part of conscious consciousness

1711
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,880
but but that consciousness is is there

1712
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,040
all along. I was really proud of of um

1713
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,440
this statement that was signed by all

1714
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,880
these amazing uh neuro uh scientists uh

1715
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,679
in the last six months that declared

1716
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,719
that they have enough data now uh to

1717
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,000
show that all animals have at least some

1718
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,800
levels of consciousness including

1719
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,280
insects and everything. And then and

1720
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,000
because the data is showing that they do

1721
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,239
things for fun, right? Anybody that has

1722
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:34,000
a dog could have told you that. But the

1723
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,280
fact that um the fact that the human

1724
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,400
society is now declaring this officially

1725
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,280
that yes, animals have consciousness.

1726
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,760
Dolphins will suck on a puffer fish to

1727
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,679
get high in the ocean. You know, there's

1728
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,600
there's many different examples of this.

1729
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,239
Yeah. Basically even bees they can see

1730
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,440
in insect that they do things u for the

1731
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,400
enjoyment of it and that so that there's

1732
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,639
certain level of aware they're not just

1733
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,440
doing thing to feed themsel or replicate

1734
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,400
and so on. it's not mechanical that they

1735
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,239
actually enjoy uh their time as well. uh

1736
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,360
is making the scientific community say

1737
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,360
okay so there's a certain level of

1738
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,159
consciousness all along and what I'm

1739
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:24,000
saying is that actually extends and that

1740
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,239
the scientific community is not there

1741
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:29,199
yet because I haven't given them the

1742
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,800
equations but that's on its way um you

1743
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,840
know it extends all the way to down to

1744
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,360
the plung field it it that is the pulse

1745
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,960
of that that information set. And so

1746
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,560
like the material world is actually as

1747
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,440
well, you know, part of this feedback of

1748
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,199
information getting more and more

1749
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,080
complex, getting more and more advanced

1750
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,560
and making things that are less advanced

1751
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,360
at first and then more and more advanced

1752
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,040
eventually to a human being that is you

1753
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,719
know highly has high enough complexity

1754
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:12,239
that it become aware of itself. So

1755
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:15,440
you're speaking to consciousness as a

1756
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,679
essentially a force that runs upon all

1757
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:19,440
scales but the there's a point in which

1758
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,520
it becomes aware of itself which only

1759
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,679
you know certain certain uh levels of

1760
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,920
complexity and density of of systems can

1761
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,159
achieve right so in a way from like the

1762
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:35,679
metaphysical or philosophical

1763
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,000
understanding like I am runs throughout

1764
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,159
all existence I am that I am or

1765
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,760
awareness of awareness Awareness

1766
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,199
essentially is for certain certain

1767
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,320
levels of development within um human or

1768
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,960
other other life that can recognize self

1769
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,880
in a mirror for example. But I think

1770
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,360
it's when you explore the different ways

1771
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,000
in which qualia shows up in different

1772
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,239
life forms. For example, an octopus or a

1773
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,320
mantis strip that has 12 different

1774
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,239
channels of color, right? And these

1775
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,360
different ways in which um people uh you

1776
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,719
know different things within existence

1777
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,639
are having an experience of itself is

1778
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,080
very very fascinating. Um, and it just

1779
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,920
starts to push our boundaries and scope

1780
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,920
of understanding of what we think life

1781
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,840
is and what's what's possible within

1782
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,679
life, right? Because Yeah. It's not

1783
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,679
necessarily accurate to say that only

1784
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,600
the human

1785
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,480
um species has become aware of itself.

1786
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,840
No, for sure. There's a lot of other

1787
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,560
animals that can recognize itself in a

1788
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,600
mirror apes. And yeah. Well, there's

1789
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,440
more and more evidence of that. Yeah. I

1790
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,440
mean, certainly with dolphins, it's been

1791
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,040
demonstrated.

1792
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,480
um you know I don't know what exactly

1793
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,880
the state is of that type of of um

1794
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,840
studies are um because it's not my field

1795
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,719
of expertise but I would suggest that

1796
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,480
it's like it it's like a gradient of

1797
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,320
change like it's like an evolution of

1798
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,120
the material world. I mean, really, when

1799
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,719
you look at us, we're like water bags

1800
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,719
with a bunch of minerals in it that have

1801
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:16,880
self-organized, you know, that vortex

1802
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,960
itself into a self-organized system that

1803
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,960
is

1804
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,520
transferring information and acting upon

1805
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,480
it, right? Like it it it's it's really a

1806
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,560
remarkable thing. But it but it took it

1807
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,560
it takes the whole scale from atomic or

1808
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,159
subatomic particle or even PL scale all

1809
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,960
the way to the biological scale for the

1810
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,000
whole thing to work together. And so

1811
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,440
that's why I make a little bit of fun of

1812
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,080
the neurologists that look at the brain

1813
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,880
and try to find this the seat of

1814
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
consciousness in the brain by analyzing

1815
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,080
chemical change in the brain and saying

1816
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,480
it's not quantum because the brain is

1817
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,120
too warm and too wet. It's it can't be

1818
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,520
quantum. It must be at the biological

1819
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,040
scale. And and I I I just say to that,

1820
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,239
well, you know, like it would be like an

1821
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,199
astrophysicist that's looking at a

1822
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,920
galaxy, analyzing a galaxy, and that

1823
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,880
ignores the stars in it because they're

1824
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,679
too far remote in terms of size to the

1825
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,080
galactic disc. Well, if you're going to

1826
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,760
ignore the stars, you're going to miss

1827
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,159
the whole thing, right? You know the

1828
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,199
cells of your brain and everything

1829
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:42,400
you're made of is made out of atoms and

1830
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,080
at the atomic level the energy levels

1831
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,679
are much higher and this is where you

1832
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,600
know we need to look if we want to

1833
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,000
understand the nature of the information

1834
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,440
network that we see at larger scale that

1835
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,480
are developed from the atomic structure.

1836
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,280
So you see I get into a lot of trouble

1837
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,880
in many ways

1838
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:10,800
and I love you know what people there's

1839
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,840
so many brilliant people are so

1840
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,120
brilliant it's amazing um it's just that

1841
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,000
the educational system has a tendency to

1842
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,880
really like fracture and

1843
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,639
compartmentalize studies so that the the

1844
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,639
person that studied the molecular

1845
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,960
structure ignores ignores the atomic

1846
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,360
structure. The person that studied the

1847
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,520
the atomic structure ignores the

1848
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,880
molecular or the biological structure.

1849
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,000
You know, like this this is, you know,

1850
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,840
it's the problem this like all this

1851
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,560
fragmentation of our science and then it

1852
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,679
doesn't speak across the scale anymore.

1853
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,600
Yeah. Yeah. So, do you think everything

1854
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,320
in the universe is an equation of sorts?

1855
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,440
like everything is essentially

1856
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,880
mathematical in the way that um if

1857
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,719
you're looking to build towards a

1858
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,840
unified theory of everything is that

1859
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,520
possible within I guess the limited even

1860
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,360
though we have contain we could like you

1861
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,120
spoke to contain information from the

1862
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,320
whole within the part within the system

1863
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,040
is it possible to gain awareness through

1864
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,800
an equation with a theory of everything

1865
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,199
that explains the whole outside of the

1866
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,040
system I feel like and it's been talked

1867
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,800
about how you may have to be outside of

1868
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,239
the system fully to be able to

1869
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,000
understand what it is which makes sense.

1870
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,320
Mhm. So you think it's possible to have

1871
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,960
a theory of everything? Is that possible

1872
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,320
in your eyes? I think so. Absolutely. I

1873
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:44,440
I I um I think that like it's actually

1874
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,639
inevitable. Um inevitable. It's

1875
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,560
inevitable in the fact inevitable. Yes.

1876
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Sorry, my my English now that I live in

1877
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,360
France in France and speak French a lot.

1878
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,080
I my English is going it's not good. I

1879
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,440
got a train. But um I think it's a

1880
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,600
natural consequence of what's going to

1881
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,239
happen. I I want to rectify your

1882
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,639
statement a little

1883
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:10,960
bit. Mathematical physicists which most

1884
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,960
physicists that are doing fundamental

1885
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,040
physics today are mathematical

1886
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,600
physicists. And what I mean by that they

1887
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,000
mostly do mathematics and they don't

1888
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,440
necessarily relate it well to physics

1889
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,320
meaning like the real that's

1890
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,600
happening in the real world right there

1891
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,360
these books that are published called

1892
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,520
lost in math you know and things like

1893
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,840
that because they're in like 11

1894
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,360
dimensions of strings and you know 10 to

1895
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,920
the 500

1896
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,360
compactification you know possibility

1897
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,719
when you know reality is most likely

1898
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,639
vastly different from that. But uh so

1899
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:55,280
there's this saying that you hear

1900
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,000
physicists and mathematical and or

1901
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,880
mathematician even say is the universe

1902
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,080
is ma mathematical in nature. There's

1903
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,320
famous people that did that said that in

1904
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,880
history and we keep repeating that and I

1905
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,320
disagree with that. I I I disagree

1906
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,960
fundamentally with that. I think the

1907
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,880
universe doesn't do mathematics. It

1908
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,280
doesn't really care, you know, what the

1909
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,440
humans with their Greek letters are

1910
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,000
writing on a piece of paper. I don't

1911
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,360
think it builds using mathematics. What

1912
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,719
the universe does is geometry. Geometry

1913
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,760
is fundamental. And what I mean by

1914
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,679
geometry is ratios. It does ratios,

1915
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:39,920
relationship. It's all relationship. And

1916
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,639
the relationship produce the constants

1917
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,800
that we see, the forces that we see, the

1918
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,360
energy that we see that it's all

1919
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,120
relationships. And when you look at the

1920
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,719
mathematics we write for the universe,

1921
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,360
we see these relationships like the

1922
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,760
relationship between energy and mass,

1923
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,000
you know, the all the things we see in

1924
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,480
relationships. Um, so ratios, geometry

1925
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,080
is what the universe does. And then the

1926
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,159
human have

1927
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,760
you know uh made systems of

1928
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:17,920
mathematics with symbology with like

1929
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,440
ways of describing things models to try

1930
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,400
to describe these relationship to the to

1931
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,600
try to describe this geometry that the

1932
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,159
universe does. So I I like to think of

1933
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:33,280
it more reverse. The universe is

1934
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:38,040
geometric in nature and relationships in

1935
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,960
nature. And we write mathematics to

1936
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,840
understand these

1937
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,960
relationships. And I mean we see this

1938
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,639
and we can observe throughout all of

1939
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,520
nature throughout all the cosmos.

1940
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,320
um how there's significant patterns and

1941
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,440
ratios that show up like the number 108

1942
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,199
in terms of how many moons fit between

1943
01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:00,239
the earth and the moon and um the how

1944
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,719
many earths fit between how this the

1945
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:05,520
diameter of the sun and it goes on and

1946
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,600
on and on from the from the macro to the

1947
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,560
micro and it is yeah we see geometry we

1948
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:16,360
see ratios that are very um um that are

1949
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,920
very sustained across different scales

1950
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,199
we see. We see for instance the the

1951
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,600
golden ratio

1952
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,960
um you know show up or or the Fibonacci

1953
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,320
series would be more accurate you know

1954
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,040
show up in many different scales in our

1955
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,320
universe from galaxy arms to you know

1956
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,600
flowers on our planet and so on and so

1957
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,440
it's like yeah they they seem to be

1958
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,920
repeating

1959
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:50,080
ratios fractal kind of things you know

1960
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,199
the way things divide and the ratio the

1961
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,159
universe used to make these divisions it

1962
01:32:56,159 --> 01:33:00,520
it you can see that there's some kind of

1963
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,400
coherent pattern that is developed by

1964
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,120
nature and that was how I started my

1965
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,199
exploration when I was young it's like I

1966
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,000
want to understand this pattern and then

1967
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,400
I thought if I can write the math of

1968
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,679
this pattern I should find all of the

1969
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,400
fundamental constants we measure in

1970
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:24,159
physics and I and and I did I it's not

1971
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,320
published yet it that's in the third

1972
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,239
paper the paper I just published is a

1973
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:32,400
series of three and so it will come but

1974
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,199
but you know we measure the gravitation

1975
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:37,199
the gravitational constant we measure

1976
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:39,600
the right constant we measure alpha we

1977
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,920
measure we measure all these things that

1978
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,239
we call fundamental constants of

1979
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:48,000
physics but we don't know where they

1980
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,800
come from right. Well, when you do these

1981
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,159
ratios and you understand how this

1982
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:59,320
fundamental field uh creates

1983
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,639
relationship, then you find these

1984
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,719
constants emerge naturally from these uh

1985
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,000
from these theories. So it's it's very

1986
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,960
powerful because now you

1987
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,199
understand how these constants and what

1988
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,159
are the mechanics of these constants. I

1989
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,120
think so many of us get aruck just

1990
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,239
glancing at the inherent intelligence

1991
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,440
that's weaved throughout all of

1992
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:29,600
creation. Like the finely attuned ratios

1993
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,600
that hold everything in balance just

1994
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,360
right. If it was off just a little bit

1995
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,960
on one way or the other, it wouldn't be

1996
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,560
come to be. Yeah. It's called a fine

1997
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,960
tuning problem, right? Yeah. And so um I

1998
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,679
think that uh like there would be none

1999
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,199
of planets, stars, galaxies if alpha was

2000
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:50,320
a little bit off or G was a little bit

2001
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,280
off like by very little and then nothing

2002
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,080
would have come together. Yeah. So so

2003
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,800
it's highly tuned. Yeah. Yeah. Did you

2004
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,239
have a moment because I think a lot of

2005
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:03,760
us um are just aruck at the sheer level

2006
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,000
of intelligence and organization between

2007
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,960
the coh and the coherent universe. But

2008
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,280
you and your early 20s like was there an

2009
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,639
experience or what kicked you off down

2010
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:14,320
this path initially? I'm just curious as

2011
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,000
for your personal journey because for

2012
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,800
you to devote your life to this, I would

2013
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,719
only assume that it was either a

2014
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:22,960
fundamental drive and passion that was

2015
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,880
just within you for a while or maybe you

2016
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,199
had a series of experiences that really

2017
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,120
motivated you down this path. Well, it's

2018
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:32,320
both. you know, I had moments of, you

2019
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,280
know, deep um knowing and and

2020
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,679
illuminations that that got me on this

2021
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,440
path, but as well a bunch of uh

2022
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,719
different uh circumstances that like

2023
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,639
made it so that um you know, I was uh

2024
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,360
thinking about this really profoundly. I

2025
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,639
was like spending significant amount of

2026
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:01,840
time meditating on the nature of this of

2027
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,920
all these relationship. What is the

2028
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,639
fundamental geometry of this thing? Why

2029
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,000
why were you doing that? Why were you

2030
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,280
meditating on that? Uh because I wanted

2031
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,880
to know like how did I get here? I was I

2032
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,639
was kind of surprised that people

2033
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,120
weren't asking that question. Yeah. They

2034
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,840
they it seemed like we just get here and

2035
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,000
then we get told this is what you do,

2036
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,040
right? You you you go to school, right?

2037
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,760
As soon as like you can't barely walk,

2038
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,920
you know, you get stuck in this

2039
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,639
institution and you you just sit down

2040
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,159
and we're going to teach you all this

2041
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:38,239
stuff. And so then you learn, learn,

2042
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,080
learn, learn. And then as soon as you

2043
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,159
get out now, you got to get a job. You

2044
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,760
got to get married, you got to get the

2045
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,719
house, get the car,

2046
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:49,840
get and it's like, and I was all struck

2047
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,080
when I was I I remember having these

2048
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,480
thoughts when I was like seven or eight,

2049
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,040
you know, thinking why are we doing all

2050
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:01,040
this? Like where is it going? Like how

2051
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,520
are and nobody was asking that? How did

2052
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,520
I get here?

2053
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,360
what is this like what is this

2054
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,320
experience I'm having like you know like

2055
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,199
very fundamentally and it's I was really

2056
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,920
str and then I realized oh yeah they do

2057
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,080
ask that question typically like hours

2058
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,199
before they pass you know hour before

2059
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,520
they pass they go what was this whole

2060
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,400
experience I just had of 80 years or

2061
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,600
whatever you know and but it's like now

2062
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,920
you got hours to figure it out so I

2063
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,080
figure I better start asking the

2064
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,719
question early because I might need a

2065
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,360
lot of time to figure it out and I I

2066
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,600
sure did. You know, I needed a lot of

2067
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,320
time and I think I'm getting really

2068
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,280
close. But they but the a remarkable

2069
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,080
thing is that there's always deeper

2070
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,880
levels and deeper levels and it just and

2071
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,440
every time like you know you get

2072
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,719
completely transformed when you when you

2073
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,400
you know discover deeper levels of of

2074
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,400
the amazing coordination and like like

2075
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,520
you know one turn of the proton is the

2076
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,400
universe refresh rate you know and and

2077
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,159
things like that you know it really it

2078
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,119
really when you it's not just an

2079
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,280
equation. It's not just a concept. It's

2080
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,639
like oh you can start to feel it in your

2081
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,280
body when it's really true. You can

2082
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,960
start to feel it in your body. It's in

2083
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,920
your awareness like you can start to

2084
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,800
feel your relationship with this field

2085
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,520
and it's

2086
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,400
powerful. It's transformative.

2087
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,960
And I and and my conclusion is that the

2088
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,520
universe is learning about itself and

2089
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,320
we're the probes at at the end. You know

2090
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,600
Einstein said

2091
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,639
um object are not in

2092
01:38:57,639 --> 01:39:02,159
space objects are an extension of the

2093
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:05,040
space right and he was saying that

2094
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,719
because he was talking about the fact

2095
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,800
that space is not empty the zero point

2096
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,320
energy and all this and and he said like

2097
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,960
you know as a consequence so we can't

2098
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,040
think of space as empty it space is full

2099
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,520
it's it's the source of how an object

2100
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,400
object emerge, you know, how things

2101
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,760
emerge like to start to think that way.

2102
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,199
I think Einstein was definitely on it.

2103
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,719
And you might say, well, why didn't

2104
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,639
Einstein, he was a smart guy, right?

2105
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,360
Like why didn't he unify the field then?

2106
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,920
Well, he didn't have the tools. He was

2107
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,119
missing some stuff. One of the things he

2108
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,600
was missing the

2109
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:48,960
most was what his theory predicted.

2110
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,360
Meaning he his theory of general

2111
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:55,119
relativity predicts black holes. In

2112
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,440
fact, it doesn't predict anything else

2113
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,239
than black holes. Right? The solution to

2114
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:03,199
Einstein field equation is a black hole.

2115
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:07,360
It's a switch out solution. And and but

2116
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,040
he didn't believe they they existed. So

2117
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,440
I am very fascinated at how our the

2118
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,760
unique things in life that bring us joy

2119
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,600
and and and excite us to move and

2120
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,000
discover different fields of study. It

2121
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,440
almost feels like there's this divine

2122
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,679
orchestration that draw us to you know

2123
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:27,080
on one hand these

2124
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,280
discoveries as we start to make space

2125
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,440
for what wants to emerge from within us

2126
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,560
but also who we become on the process of

2127
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,440
doing the work in the world is uh is I

2128
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,239
feel like the real fruit of the path and

2129
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,880
you mentioned that you've had alongside

2130
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,040
your study and field of work

2131
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,040
transformative experiences both in the

2132
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,719
realization of the profoundity of what

2133
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:51,199
you're discovering but also you know

2134
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:54,080
firsthand uh experiences that felt

2135
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,320
transformative and when you look back on

2136
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,159
that time would you care to share one or

2137
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,679
two of those pivotal moments where you

2138
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,040
had an experience that you feel like

2139
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,520
really transformed you?

2140
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,920
Well, I mean one of the most known one

2141
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:10,480
that I've discussed in many of my

2142
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,800
lectures is when I was approximately 10

2143
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,360
years old. I don't know exactly it was

2144
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,280
around there. Um I got my first lesson

2145
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,239
in geometry and and I had a very similar

2146
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:27,440
experience than uh Buckminister Fuller

2147
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,199
had prior to me um which was you know

2148
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,840
the teacher made a dot on the blackboard

2149
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,800
and said that's dimension zero and it

2150
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,360
doesn't have volume and doesn't exist

2151
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,520
and I

2152
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:44,159
thought I've going to fail this class. I

2153
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:45,600
know I'm going to fail this class

2154
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,400
because I see the dot. So if I see the

2155
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,360
dot, it's it's got some volume. If I

2156
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,679
look at the chalk on the blackboard with

2157
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,639
an electron microscope, it's got volume.

2158
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,040
Um, you know,

2159
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,199
so what do you mean it doesn't exist?

2160
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,280
You mean the concept of the dot doesn't

2161
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,960
exist? I So you see this

2162
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:13,040
extrapolation from from an analogy.

2163
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,800
We make analogies and we assume that we

2164
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,840
because we made an

2165
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:22,000
analogy. It's the way the universe work

2166
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,760
is is the error, right? And so uh then

2167
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,600
the bunch of dot makes the line that

2168
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,320
makes dimension one. You know the four

2169
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,679
line makes a plane that makes the

2170
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,600
dimension uh two and then the six planes

2171
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,000
get put together to make a cube that

2172
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,840
makes dimension three. you know that I I

2173
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,920
was more and more confused because if

2174
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,760
the dot didn't exist and the line

2175
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,040
doesn't exist then you know the the the

2176
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,199
plane cannot exist because it's defined

2177
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:56,000
by four lines and and then if the planes

2178
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,560
doesn't exist well you haven't enclosed

2179
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,800
anything when you've made a cube with

2180
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,840
non-existing planes you just got

2181
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,679
non-existence to the fourth you you know

2182
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,679
and

2183
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:09,920
so it's like this cannot be it like how

2184
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,679
do I solve that riddle

2185
01:43:12,679 --> 01:43:16,239
And I going home I was I had like an

2186
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:18,400
hour long bus ride because I was not

2187
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,920
doing well at school. I was very

2188
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,639
dyslexic and I kept on you know having

2189
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,400
to be transferred to other schools you

2190
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,719
know further and further from my house.

2191
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:32,239
Um and so I had an hour and a half bus

2192
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:35,040
ride coming home. And and so I was

2193
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,360
thinking about this in the bus and I

2194
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,760
realized actually the only way you can

2195
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,520
solve this is by saying the exact

2196
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,520
contrary. The only thing that exists is

2197
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,639
the dot the singularity and that

2198
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:49,280
singularity can be divide to infinity.

2199
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,119
So I was I I I didn't know to use the

2200
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:55,760
word fractal. I didn't I I didn't know

2201
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,480
about contour that had come up with

2202
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,520
infinite amount of infinities. I I I

2203
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,520
didn't know all these things. But I was

2204
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,520
starting to think the universe hit must

2205
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,159
have like in like I was thinking wow the

2206
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,239
cells are so small and then the atoms

2207
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,400
are so small and then the subatomic

2208
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,320
particles are so small and I was

2209
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,199
thinking oh this solar system is so

2210
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,040
small relative to the galaxy and the

2211
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,719
galaxy is so small relative to the

2212
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,080
cluster and the cluster to the

2213
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,400
supercluster and the supercluster in the

2214
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,159
universe and our universe could be in a

2215
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,560
larger one and you know and I started to

2216
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,480
think oh okay it's like all dots at

2217
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,040
different scales that have different

2218
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,679
levels of complexity in them, different

2219
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,119
energy levels at all the scales. And I

2220
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:47,520
really I mean was really close to what

2221
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,560
I'm writing right now and that was at

2222
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,440
the age of 10, right? So that this is

2223
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:58,960
this is 50 years ago and um I uh and it

2224
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,400
really launched me to try to understand

2225
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:06,480
the fractal the fractal nature of space

2226
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,000
to try to understand you know the

2227
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,719
relationship between the scale the

2228
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,880
energy transfer from one scale to the

2229
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,440
other and all this and eventually and

2230
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,400
but it was a profound moment because as

2231
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,760
at the same time uh when I was turning

2232
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,280
11, I learned to meditate, you know, uh

2233
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,440
and I was uh and I realized oh okay

2234
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,480
meditation is like looking inwards

2235
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:37,119
instead of looking outwards all the time

2236
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:40,159
taking some time to and inward you know

2237
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:44,239
if you try to imagine infinity outward

2238
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,840
it's like you run out of bits you know

2239
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,639
like it's too much you can't like take

2240
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,000
it land. But if you actually start to

2241
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,400
think of infinity as like divisions

2242
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,560
within

2243
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:02,159
you, then you get a sense of infinite

2244
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,679
amount of infinities like Caner

2245
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:07,920
described. You know, you get a sense of

2246
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,320
this fractal nature within. So

2247
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,800
infinitely small is the way you want to

2248
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,920
go if you're trying to like reach

2249
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,920
singularity within, you know. So, so

2250
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,520
those had impact. I many many other

2251
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,400
stories. I mean times in I was a

2252
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,960
mountain guy. I was a ski guide. There

2253
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,719
was uh you know and and times in the

2254
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:35,440
mountains that were like profound

2255
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,480
profound moments of you know uh just

2256
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,960
spontaneous moments of of feeling

2257
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,760
complete connectivity with my

2258
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,480
environment with the natural world

2259
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:52,760
around me of feeling of of uh deep

2260
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:56,400
knowledge you know uh pouring in like

2261
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,800
very profound moment. moments that left

2262
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,199
me completely changed and transformed.

2263
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:10,480
Yeah. So, so I mean so many so many of

2264
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,400
these moments when doing exercises for

2265
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,520
instance like getting in the zone,

2266
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,840
right? So, for instance, I was a solo

2267
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,320
climber. Um, so I love to solo climb,

2268
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,639
you know, and and I would go up

2269
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,520
thousands of feet, you know, no ropes,

2270
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,560
just shoes and chuck and and it was like

2271
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,280
looking at the crystals and the rock as

2272
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,719
I was climbing and the, you know,

2273
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:42,600
beautiful level of

2274
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:46,960
of zoning into the field and having the

2275
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,800
most amazing time and finding the edge.

2276
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,679
you know between fear and complete

2277
01:47:54,679 --> 01:47:57,679
ecstasy right like he it's because in

2278
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,119
these state where like one error is the

2279
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:06,239
end right the the you have this you find

2280
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:10,480
that edge so clearly between fear and

2281
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:13,920
ecstasy you know and and it's so nice

2282
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,600
you get so clear feedback uh in this

2283
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,719
case in climbing because As you're

2284
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,199
climbing, if you start having thoughts

2285
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:25,360
you're going to fall, if you look down

2286
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,600
and start thinking you're going to fall,

2287
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,639
it's almost instantaneous. I feel it

2288
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,639
right now talking about it's almost

2289
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,040
instantaneous. Your your hands and your

2290
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,080
palm of your hands starts to get wet.

2291
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,320
You know, you start sweating. It's

2292
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,199
almost instantaneous. And and so more

2293
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:44,880
you're you're afraid, more you're

2294
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,119
sweating, more you're slipping. Yeah.

2295
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:50,000
And it's just a bad feedback, right?

2296
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,880
It's not looking good for you. And and

2297
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,920
you have to overcome the fear thoughts

2298
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,080
and think, "Oh, you know, I'm having a

2299
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,239
beautiful day. It's gorgeous. I'm going

2300
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,920
to be at the top enjoying this." And you

2301
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,840
know, and and then as soon as you

2302
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,400
overcome the fear, boom, you're back in

2303
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,480
and you're fine. And you keep going,

2304
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,719
right? So this these were

2305
01:49:13,719 --> 01:49:16,560
moments that were important for me

2306
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,600
because I I was terrified to do this

2307
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,400
work. I mean I wasn't terrified to do

2308
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,920
the work. I I because I was so and I am

2309
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,800
still so passionate about it. I but at

2310
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,199
the time I was definitely terrified to

2311
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,600
try to bring it to the world. You know,

2312
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,239
like I knew I was going to get tomatoes

2313
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:39,520
thrown at me one after the other and you

2314
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,760
know what was going to that do to my

2315
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,560
self-esteem to my feeling of security of

2316
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:49,760
self you know like I I had many reason

2317
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,840
to be afraid

2318
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,960
um and at the same time I felt it was my

2319
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,840
duty to to bring this knowledge to the

2320
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:01,520
world and I had to be okay with enduring

2321
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,080
and and and that those things would make

2322
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,679
me grow, you know, and and I've grown.

2323
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:12,000
I've grown. I I'm so much better now I

2324
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
at um receiving criticism.

2325
01:50:18,119 --> 01:50:21,199
Uh and it's still hard. It hurts your

2326
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:24,119
heart, especially if it's, you know,

2327
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:27,600
unjustified. If you know if if somebody

2328
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,520
looks at my equation and says, "Okay,

2329
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,080
this term here is false or it's wrong or

2330
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,639
this equation is false or you have to

2331
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,960
fix this or that, you know, thank God,

2332
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,440
thank you for telling me or let me work

2333
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:45,520
this out." Um, but when it's like you're

2334
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,639
an idiot or, you know, like you know,

2335
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:51,440
you're a crackpot, you know, like then

2336
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:56,000
it's it hurts. Um, and it's not so much

2337
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,639
what they're saying about me that hurts.

2338
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,239
is when I see people that were

2339
01:51:01,239 --> 01:51:03,560
interested get

2340
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:06,800
diverted because they heard something

2341
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,760
from somebody that had nothing to do

2342
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,440
with the physics, you know, then it it

2343
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,400
it hurts my heart that that person was

2344
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,960
interested and now thinks I'm a crackpot

2345
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,159
because they read it on some thread, you

2346
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:25,440
know, on Reddit or whatever, you know,

2347
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,480
and that's that's painful to see.

2348
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,440
Yeah. Have you found any comfort in the

2349
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,440
observation that some of the greatest

2350
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,960
thinkers in the past that have brought

2351
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,639
forth novel discovery that were a

2352
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,480
paradigm shift for the planet were all

2353
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,360
notoriously hated or shunned or almost

2354
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,320
killed called crack bots and yeah not

2355
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,320
just almost killed many were killed.

2356
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,360
So yeah, you know, it helps. It doesn't

2357
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,599
make it much better because it's still

2358
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:58,080
painful in the moment, but it helps you

2359
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,159
go, at least they're not burning me at

2360
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,639
the steak or cutting my ear off or, you

2361
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,880
know, like I can, you know, um, so it's

2362
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:11,199
not as violent as it used to be. Uh, but

2363
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:14,320
it's still painful. Yeah. I'm curious

2364
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:15,679
because we're here. I want to ask you

2365
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:17,599
cuz there are many in the scientific

2366
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,480
community that that kind of cringe at

2367
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,040
this what they feel is an unjustified

2368
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,800
leap from examining this quantum

2369
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,560
strangeness to macroscopic effects like

2370
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,400
med like uh manifestation and they feel

2371
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,520
like there's some handwaving or like um

2372
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,000
where where it's just unjustified in the

2373
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
explanation of saying because we're all

2374
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,599
interconnected at this quantum level

2375
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:44,159
where things are strange to then say

2376
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:48,239
that um there's these uh you know more I

2377
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,159
guess denser realities like

2378
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:53,040
manifestation that that operate. I'm

2379
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,360
just curious what your thoughts on on

2380
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,159
that are um both the criticism but then

2381
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,880
also if you care to share the literal

2382
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,480
mechanisms of of of how that works.

2383
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,040
Yeah. I mean that's a complex issue and

2384
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:12,199
it has to do with the fact that the

2385
01:53:12,199 --> 01:53:15,119
handwaving doesn't come from the people

2386
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:16,880
that are saying these things although

2387
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,760
they're doing some handwaving too. It

2388
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,080
actually as well come from the way the

2389
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,239
Copenagen interpretation of the double

2390
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:28,639
slid experiment occurred like this idea

2391
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:30,960
of the measurement and the collapse of

2392
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,880
the wave function and all

2393
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,920
this that that has quite a bit of

2394
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,719
handwaving in it and I'm not sure what

2395
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:44,280
they were smoking in Copenagen but

2396
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:47,840
like to think that the cat is alive and

2397
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,960
dead at the same time, which is what

2398
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,199
Swinginger came up with to

2399
01:53:54,199 --> 01:53:56,719
ridiculize the interpretation of his own

2400
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,920
equation, showing that like, no, this is

2401
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,760
got to be an error. And then it got it

2402
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:05,080
it got

2403
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:08,960
popularized like to his horror, right?

2404
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,599
Um that oh yeah, this is the way it

2405
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:16,320
works, you know? Well, you know, I it's

2406
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,199
it's I think bad science. I think it's

2407
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:23,040
really bad science. And that really is

2408
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:26,480
the problem because and it's the reason

2409
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,320
it's complex because the spiritual

2410
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,960
people look at that and say, "Oh, you

2411
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,520
see, you need consciousness to make a

2412
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,239
measurement for the collapse of the wave

2413
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:38,320
function to happen and reality to

2414
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,560
emerge." And so that means consciousness

2415
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,760
is primary and da da da da. And so like

2416
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:48,599
they take off with this when I think the

2417
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:52,960
principle in its inception is false.

2418
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,760
Right? So why was it interpreted this

2419
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,280
way?

2420
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,040
Well, I'm going to tell you because they

2421
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:05,199
removed 0 energy. Because they removed

2422
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:08,880
the field. So let me explain. You have

2423
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,800
an experiment where you have one slit

2424
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,880
and you're throwing things at it. you're

2425
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,760
throwing photons or um you know

2426
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,440
electrons at it one and you're getting

2427
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,760
dots on the backboard because it's going

2428
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,760
through the slit and magn dots and then

2429
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,880
you you're like you put two slits and

2430
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,119
then all of a sudden instead of getting

2431
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:31,599
dots on both side you're getting an

2432
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,320
interference pattern on the backboard

2433
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,599
and you go wow the particle instead of

2434
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,520
thinking okay we missed

2435
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,199
something you start to think that the

2436
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:46,480
particle is splitting itself into two in

2437
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:50,000
state of superp position and it actually

2438
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,960
interfere with itself after it's gone

2439
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,040
through the slit and making the

2440
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,599
interference pattern and it's like okay

2441
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,719
what have you smoked right and and and

2442
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:07,119
and then you try to measure which slit

2443
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:10,320
did it go through right to see if you

2444
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,239
got the right interpretation And when

2445
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:14,840
you try to measure you get a third

2446
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,119
result and then you say just through the

2447
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:19,360
mere observation and measurement of that

2448
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,679
right and it changes it it changes it

2449
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,080
but you know and start you start writing

2450
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,480
physics on

2451
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:30,520
that but you could

2452
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:34,679
have interpret this completely

2453
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:37,599
differently except you couldn't have if

2454
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:39,280
you think that the particle you're

2455
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,119
shooting at the slit is isolated from

2456
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:47,040
the field. Right? So the if you think

2457
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,880
the particle is in a field-f free

2458
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,800
environment, you you've got an a

2459
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:55,320
problem and it will result into this

2460
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,440
interpretation. But now put the field

2461
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:00,480
back in. put the zero point back in and

2462
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,560
realize that what you're shooting is

2463
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,560
actually like a a dynamic of a field

2464
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,199
that's making waves as it moves just

2465
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:13,960
like a boat makes waves on the

2466
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,440
ocean. So now it's a particle in a wave

2467
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,639
not because it's in some kind of magical

2468
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:24,239
quantum state. It's just the mechanics

2469
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:28,560
of fluid dynamics of a field, right? And

2470
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,199
so when you have one slit, it makes dot.

2471
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,679
When you have two slit, the waves that

2472
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:35,440
the particle made goes through the

2473
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,440
second slit interfere and makes

2474
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:40,159
intervant pattern. And then when you put

2475
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:43,520
an instrument to measure that instrument

2476
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,719
is making waves as well and it's

2477
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,560
cancelling the wave of the particle that

2478
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,280
makes a third

2479
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,639
result right just because of the

2480
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,080
particles that are emanating from the

2481
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,679
physical instrument that's making the

2482
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,920
observation or in what way is it

2483
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,920
interfering within the yeah I mean

2484
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,159
you're you're using photon whatever

2485
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:07,199
you're using to measure right you have

2486
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:11,360
to tune it to the to the harmonic

2487
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,000
frequency of your experiment. It's not

2488
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,639
just any measurement device. And when

2489
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:19,679
you do that, you're basically cancelling

2490
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,119
the waveform that the particle is making

2491
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:24,880
in the field. So, of course, you're

2492
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,199
getting a different result, but it's

2493
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:29,760
just because it's field interaction.

2494
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,840
This is called um pilot wave theory. So,

2495
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,280
I came up with it in my van on my own in

2496
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,840
the 90s, you know, isolated in the

2497
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,520
mountains being my climber self. And I

2498
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,360
thought, "Oh, I figured it out." And

2499
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,840
then it's like, "No, somebody figured

2500
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,480
that out long before you, right?

2501
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,159
Debuglier um and uh others bomb

2502
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:56,080
eventually." It's a big bummer. It's

2503
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:57,599
like when you make a song on piano and

2504
01:58:57,599 --> 01:58:59,119
you realize you just wrote like a big

2505
01:58:59,119 --> 01:59:00,800
hit that's already out there. That's

2506
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,280
already out there. Yeah. Exactly. And I

2507
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,280
was like, "No, but I was glad they had

2508
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:08,639
figured it out because then eventually

2509
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:14,159
uh MIT in the '9s took a bag of uh fluid

2510
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,520
um it was silicone fluid with silicone

2511
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:20,560
beads, oscillated the bag, the back, you

2512
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,119
know, and then shot the beads at the SL

2513
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:26,639
and got all the same result as the

2514
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,880
Copenagen interpretation, but just with

2515
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,199
fluid

2516
01:59:30,199 --> 01:59:32,599
dynamics, right? just with fluid

2517
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:35,599
dynamics and and then they took the back

2518
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:38,480
and they spun it and then all the beads

2519
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:41,320
fell in the troughs and made like the

2520
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:45,199
quantum states, you know, and and so on.

2521
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:47,599
And it's like, wow, you know, you can do

2522
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,400
the whole thing in fluid

2523
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,000
dynamics

2524
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,920
and then you realize, wow, and and and

2525
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,639
the spiritual people might say, oh, but

2526
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,599
you're taking the magic away. And then

2527
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,639
and so people don't like that. So they

2528
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:06,639
continue with the double with the

2529
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,560
Copenagen interpretation. And it's like

2530
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:13,080
no no no no it's much more

2531
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:16,280
profound. I'm actually putting the magic

2532
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:20,159
in. It's more profound. It's saying that

2533
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:24,080
everything is interacting mediated by

2534
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:28,000
this field. Everything is producing

2535
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,360
reality by the mediation with this

2536
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:34,800
field. Everything is in relationship

2537
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,199
with everything else. You can't assume

2538
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:42,360
that it's isolated. It's all in

2539
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:46,080
connection. Everything together makes

2540
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:49,320
the collective experience we're having.

2541
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:53,599
So it's actually much more profound and

2542
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:56,480
I think it's much more correct.

2543
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:02,040
Um and to rigorously write this which we

2544
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:05,040
have and it's in the second paper. It's

2545
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,800
coming out. Um when is when is that

2546
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,199
coming out? Do you know? Uh it we're

2547
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,239
trying to get it

2548
02:01:11,239 --> 02:01:14,159
out. We were trying to get it out for

2549
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:17,040
the beginning of the year. I have

2550
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,840
feelings that's not going to happen.

2551
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:24,800
Hopefully by February or you know yeah

2552
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,719
February, May or whatever. But um you

2553
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:31,920
know we can see that like where the

2554
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,000
errors were made uh because you remove 0

2555
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,960
point energy and everything goes

2556
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,000
sideways. you you remove the field and

2557
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,520
now you're going to see things that

2558
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,360
don't that you can't

2559
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:52,480
understand and you know Einstein used to

2560
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,239
make fun of it. I think he was talking

2561
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:57,280
to Goodell when he said, "Do you really

2562
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,040
believe that when you're not looking at

2563
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:02,000
the moon, it's not there?" Right? Like,

2564
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,679
you know, local realism.

2565
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:08,960
Yeah. It's not the universe is not

2566
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:13,119
requiring the humans for it to exist. If

2567
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:16,320
if a tree falls in the forest, it makes

2568
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:19,040
a noise and it doesn't care if there's a

2569
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,199
human around to listen to it. There's

2570
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:23,360
all kinds of other things listening to

2571
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,880
it. The bugs, the fleas on the cat is

2572
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,360
the flea on the cat inside the box. The

2573
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,960
sword in your back box is not confused.

2574
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:36,000
The universe is not confused about the

2575
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,199
state of the cat. Just the human is

2576
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,639
confused about the state of the cat.

2577
02:02:41,639 --> 02:02:46,520
Now, so you know there's

2578
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:49,239
uncertainties in but it's only

2579
02:02:49,239 --> 02:02:51,920
uncertainties because we're observing

2580
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,560
from our perspective. The universe

2581
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,320
itself is not uncertain about its state.

2582
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,840
It can get a little bit into the weeds

2583
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,440
in terms of what you think something

2584
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,440
actually is and how it exists

2585
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:06,080
independent of your own observation.

2586
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:07,760
Well, you know, it's just that the

2587
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:10,239
universe is not humanentric. Of course,

2588
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:12,880
it really isn't. Which is the biggest uh

2589
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,239
I think there's a saying that

2590
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:16,320
enlightenment is the biggest bummer to

2591
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,760
the ego or something, you know? It's

2592
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,520
like we want to be the center of the

2593
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:21,679
universe, you know.

2594
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:23,760
Well, you know, that's the thing, you

2595
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,320
know. It's like when you reach higher

2596
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:30,400
levels of exist of of awareness, you can

2597
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,679
become, you know, a master, which you

2598
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:35,400
are. Okay.

2599
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:40,440
Um and and the ego can take off and go

2600
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:42,599
sideways.

2601
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:46,639
Um but if you're truly a master,

2602
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:49,920
um you're quite aware that everybody's a

2603
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,760
master as well cuz everybody has all the

2604
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,080
information. You're not actually

2605
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:57,840
teaching anything to anybody. You're

2606
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,840
just helping them to remember what they

2607
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,760
already know. Yeah. Like Gandhi said, to

2608
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,599
a pure heart, all hearts are pure. And

2609
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:06,800
similarly, a a bodhic satta, someone

2610
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,239
who's awakened to their true nature,

2611
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,639
sees that as everyone else as well.

2612
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:13,199
Exactly. The Buddha was asked, "Well,

2613
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:15,199
Buddha, you keep saying everybody is the

2614
02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:17,280
Buddha, but we don't feel like the

2615
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,840
Buddha." Like, what's the difference

2616
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,880
between us and you if we're all Buddhas?

2617
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:25,440
And the Bu and and the Buddha answered,

2618
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,080
"The Buddha knows it's the Buddha. It's

2619
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,560
the only difference, right? If you don't

2620
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,880
know you're the

2621
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,119
master, you're not the master. You know,

2622
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:37,280
it's that straightforward. The problem

2623
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:40,000
is the ego has a problem. Like, no, no,

2624
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,239
don't don't think you're the master

2625
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,560
because that that would be a big ego

2626
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,639
tripping thing. The ego has a problem

2627
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:49,760
with that. But if if the if if knowing

2628
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,880
you're the master is knowing that

2629
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:54,800
everybody has mastery, everybody is a

2630
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:58,400
master, then you're good, right? We're

2631
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,719
all good, right? See, that's the

2632
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:03,199
important thing. What do you see as all

2633
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:04,880
this is progressing in the scientific

2634
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:07,679
work, science and spirituality merging?

2635
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:09,520
What do you feel is the reality of what

2636
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,119
that is and what it looks like in the

2637
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:13,440
coming decades?

2638
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:16,000
Um, so I think there's a really bright

2639
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,080
future for humanity if we are able to

2640
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:22,639
bring this level of information out. I

2641
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:24,679
think the next few

2642
02:05:24,679 --> 02:05:28,960
decades or even less, we're going to see

2643
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:31,280
energy extraction from vacuum

2644
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,760
fluctuation come into the world. We have

2645
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:38,320
to this is this is the last tick on the

2646
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:42,080
11th hour. You know, we have to bring

2647
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:45,040
this new level of energy production into

2648
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:48,719
the world. I think it's very much on the

2649
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,159
way and I think it's gonna change

2650
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:55,360
fundamentally our society uh when you

2651
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:59,280
can make energy anywhere you are but

2652
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:05,159
even you know like non like like not not

2653
02:06:05,159 --> 02:06:07,920
centralized eventually like your phone

2654
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,000
is going to make its own energy needs to

2655
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,560
run the you know your house is going to

2656
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,719
make its own energy that it needs to run

2657
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:16,560
like it has little device in there

2658
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,480
that's extracting energy from the

2659
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:20,320
vacuum. Your car is going to do the same

2660
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,320
thing. Your spaceship is going to do the

2661
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,679
same thing. Whatever, you know. So, so I

2662
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:29,440
see a really bright future that can

2663
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:34,880
develop for humanity if if it's allowed

2664
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,599
to happen, if it's allowed to come out,

2665
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:40,040
if it's and and

2666
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:43,679
and I think these type of technology,

2667
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:45,079
they

2668
02:06:45,079 --> 02:06:48,079
transcend your consciousness. They help

2669
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,000
your consciousness because you realize,

2670
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,560
wow, I live in an abundant universe with

2671
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,440
infinite amount of resources. I have

2672
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:00,719
never to worry about feeding myself,

2673
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:03,440
lodging myself, having power that like

2674
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:06,159
all humans can have everything they

2675
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:08,719
need. You know that there's infinite

2676
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:12,480
amount of resources. If you have um if

2677
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:15,280
you have gravity control for instance,

2678
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,840
you can go and get chunks of gold the

2679
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,800
size of you know asteroids. You know,

2680
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,880
you go in the astral belt, you find

2681
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:25,679
everything you need like water, all all

2682
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:30,119
the material you need. And so it

2683
02:07:30,119 --> 02:07:33,520
really I think this like a beautiful

2684
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,840
beautiful chapter for human beings but

2685
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,320
it's like the surface of a balloon when

2686
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,520
you put energy into it right it's it

2687
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,679
starts going more and more high

2688
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:48,000
frequency as more and more energy you

2689
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,719
put into it and then it goes into like

2690
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:53,520
chaotic pattern and it looks like it's

2691
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:54,760
going to rip

2692
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,119
apart right before it pops into the next

2693
02:07:59,119 --> 02:08:02,320
resonant frequency at a higher frequency

2694
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:06,560
and then it co you know it coheres again

2695
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:09,920
like I think we're like in that phase

2696
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,000
where it's like super chaotic and if the

2697
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,159
surface tension of the balloon is not

2698
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:18,480
strong enough it can rip apart in that

2699
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:21,159
phase before it goes to the higher

2700
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:24,480
frequency I think we're in that place

2701
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,880
where it could rip apart

2702
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,560
It it could I you know or it could

2703
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:35,760
transcend the little difficulty and you

2704
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,880
know go to the next level which would

2705
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:43,079
bene benefit all human beings on the

2706
02:08:43,079 --> 02:08:46,560
planet. Incredible. I I think that

2707
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:49,520
alongside the external manifestations of

2708
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,440
gravity controller free energy or who

2709
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:54,079
knows especially what's possible as AGI

2710
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:57,040
superpowers us to be able to examine and

2711
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,880
and do research into all these different

2712
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,119
things like protein folding for example

2713
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:03,599
or whatever. Um to sidebar that

2714
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:05,920
conversation, what do you think not just

2715
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:08,159
in what we create but in terms of how we

2716
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:10,679
understand who we are like understanding

2717
02:09:10,679 --> 02:09:12,800
ourselves, what do you think is going to

2718
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,239
be shifting there in the coming couple

2719
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,079
decades? Well, the reason I talked about

2720
02:09:16,079 --> 02:09:17,920
technology is because I think the

2721
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,960
technology is going to help us do that.

2722
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:25,679
Um, every astronaut that's gone to space

2723
02:09:25,679 --> 02:09:26,760
has

2724
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:29,360
reported really transformative

2725
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:32,000
experience looking back at the Earth,

2726
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,400
seeing that there's no lines between

2727
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:38,159
countries, you know, um that, you know,

2728
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:40,480
we're on a small little blue tank that

2729
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:43,199
we're so fragile that we're all humans.

2730
02:09:43,199 --> 02:09:46,000
You know they they all had these

2731
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,199
reporting these experiences from seeing

2732
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:52,239
the earth from from orbit. Imagine

2733
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:54,880
everybody having access to that. It

2734
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:58,880
would change our you know our awareness.

2735
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,280
I mean think of it this

2736
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:05,840
way. What like the problems of Earth

2737
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,719
become really minimal

2738
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:10,360
uh when you're orbiting

2739
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,880
Jupiter. you know, Earth is way over

2740
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:15,760
there. You're doing just fine. You have,

2741
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:18,480
you know, all the energy you need. You

2742
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,320
have everything you need. So, what I'm

2743
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:23,199
saying is, okay, but before that, you

2744
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:28,079
know, um, just the fact that if this is

2745
02:10:28,079 --> 02:10:31,840
allowed to happen, if this comes to be,

2746
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,159
it's gonna

2747
02:10:33,159 --> 02:10:34,679
change

2748
02:10:34,679 --> 02:10:38,079
profoundly the way we think of oursel.

2749
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:43,360
we're gonna like profoundly like okay I

2750
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:46,239
I'm here I'm having an experience and

2751
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:50,719
this experience is linked to like a deep

2752
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,239
well of information and I'm part of

2753
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:57,599
something so much greater than myself

2754
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,440
right and I'm part of this collective

2755
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,719
you know learning of of creation of the

2756
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:08,079
universe and so on and so I think we're

2757
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:10,800
going to learn in the next few decades

2758
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,679
if we if the balloon doesn't rip and

2759
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:16,560
explode, right? If it actually makes it

2760
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:20,480
to the next level. Um you know the the

2761
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:24,320
sense of community, the sense of oneness

2762
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:27,159
with each other, the sense of

2763
02:11:27,159 --> 02:11:31,159
collective, you know, c uh constructive

2764
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:34,719
behavior that emerge, you know, from

2765
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:37,440
understanding deeper that we're all

2766
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,599
connected through this field. I I think

2767
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,040
it's going to really transform

2768
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:46,239
um our sense. I I think that the our

2769
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:51,040
true mastery will be allowed to come

2770
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,840
out, you know, and and that's going to

2771
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:56,320
be beautiful to see. You mentioned a lot

2772
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,719
of those external technologies. Um, but

2773
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:00,360
it seems like

2774
02:12:00,360 --> 02:12:04,320
just on the same parallel as these the

2775
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,920
understanding of the external world is

2776
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,599
happening. We're seeing the fundamental

2777
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:09,119
parts in which it's made out of which we

2778
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:11,280
are also made out of. And so I'm just

2779
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:12,880
curious to see what shifts in terms of

2780
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,719
our understanding of human potential and

2781
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:17,360
what becomes normal or realizing what's

2782
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:19,920
actually natural within us because we

2783
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:23,360
live in a world right now that is in so

2784
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,840
many toxic ways kind of pushing down the

2785
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,400
human potential. And I'm just interested

2786
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:31,199
to see as that blossoms and almost as

2787
02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:35,199
the uh field of belief kind of lifts and

2788
02:12:35,199 --> 02:12:37,760
like the veil of forgetting of of our of

2789
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,280
the power that we have within us kind of

2790
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,560
lifts what starts to awaken both in the

2791
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,599
powers of being human as energetic

2792
02:12:44,599 --> 02:12:47,280
beings. Um and then everything that we

2793
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:50,000
create from it. We kind of like see it

2794
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,159
emerging right now. You know like the

2795
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:55,440
balloon example before it pops into the

2796
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,639
next one. You see islands of coherency

2797
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:02,239
start to show up on the surface of the B

2798
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:04,960
at at the next frequency, right? At the

2799
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:07,440
higher frequency, islands of coherency

2800
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,320
starts to to appear. I think these

2801
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:14,079
islands of coherencies are emerging. We

2802
02:13:14,079 --> 02:13:16,880
see it. We see so many amazing humans

2803
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,199
doing amazing things. Yeah. And also the

2804
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:20,719
organization of those humans coming

2805
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:22,679
together. Exactly.

2806
02:13:22,679 --> 02:13:26,079
And you know the piece that's largely

2807
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:30,159
missing though is the the piece that

2808
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:32,320
produced the most fear in people and

2809
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:36,239
it's the financial piece that like needs

2810
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:39,360
to plug in to like power this whole

2811
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:43,960
thing into the next um you know

2812
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:49,040
like CERN burns $1.5 billion a year in

2813
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:52,159
their budget.

2814
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:55,760
If a very small portion of that was

2815
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,760
distributed again, you know, to

2816
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:00,400
laboratories that are working on

2817
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,960
understanding 0 point energy and

2818
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,360
bringing 0 point energy technology to

2819
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:07,920
the market and all this, we would pull

2820
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,880
out of that, you know, in in we would

2821
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:13,520
pull out of the problems we have today

2822
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:18,079
very rapidly. Um, so you know, it's the

2823
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:20,400
willingness, the collective willingness,

2824
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,400
and we're starting to see it more and

2825
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:27,040
more to actually take action and and

2826
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,679
launch humanity in another direction.

2827
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:31,599
And then we need the financial

2828
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,639
structures to come behind and, you know,

2829
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:39,280
fuel that so that it can take off. And

2830
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,520
that's the part that's harder. If you

2831
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:45,119
look at all these um inventors

2832
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:48,159
throughout history that didn't succeed,

2833
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:51,920
um in most cases, it's because the

2834
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:55,199
financial structure was not there to

2835
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:59,360
support them to get it out to the world,

2836
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:03,280
right? The if they had the resources,

2837
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:06,440
uh maybe they would have done better.

2838
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:09,719
So it's it's

2839
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:13,119
problematic because for instance let's

2840
02:15:13,119 --> 02:15:17,440
say you have an inventor that has this

2841
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:21,679
kind of technology um or that has the

2842
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:25,119
you know needs resources to develop this

2843
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:30,639
kind of technology um and they go to an

2844
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:33,920
investor group or whatever an individual

2845
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,040
and so on that person, that investor

2846
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,840
group or individual has to like take

2847
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:42,800
this information and turn around and try

2848
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,599
to like, you know, do uh diligence on it

2849
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:48,520
and and

2850
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:52,480
and find and and see if like is this

2851
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,119
real? Is this

2852
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:57,040
possible? And if this was let's go back

2853
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,360
to the Wright brothers. If this was the

2854
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,239
Wright brothers two weeks prior for them

2855
02:16:02,239 --> 02:16:06,320
to get it done, right? Well, they would

2856
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:08,239
have said, "No, no, look, there's like

2857
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:10,159
hundreds of papers saying it's not

2858
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:13,119
possible." No, no, no, no. So, so then

2859
02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:16,400
that individual with the resources, they

2860
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:20,679
have to have enough trust in their inner

2861
02:16:20,679 --> 02:16:24,000
beliefs against all the experts saying,

2862
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,800
"No, no, no, no, this is not possible."

2863
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:30,400
Right? So it's it's a big challenge.

2864
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:35,920
It's a big challenge and it has defeated

2865
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,519
us so far. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So,

2866
02:16:40,519 --> 02:16:44,240
so but there's more and more people that

2867
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:48,318
are have resources that are as well, you

2868
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:53,200
know, uh realizing and evolving and, you

2869
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,200
know, understanding these deeper

2870
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,760
principles that are in the hermetic

2871
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:00,959
science and in the spiritual science and

2872
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,760
so on and that are like and that

2873
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:08,160
recognize the truth in this type of

2874
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:11,280
information, this type of science and

2875
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:15,840
that wants to support. So hopefully that

2876
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,840
gets the job done. Yeah. Well, I mean,

2877
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:20,240
my prayer is that the connections that

2878
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:22,879
are made in individually, but then also

2879
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:24,478
collectively through platforms like this

2880
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:26,080
and the conversations that I, you know,

2881
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:28,959
I see you be having more and more uh

2882
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:32,478
start to ignite that possibility within

2883
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:35,120
people and to start feeling as

2884
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,040
leadership starts to emerge in a new

2885
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,519
paradigm, you know, where the the people

2886
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:41,439
who are going against the grain of the

2887
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:43,679
current paradigm always look crazy, but

2888
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:45,519
then a discovery happens or something

2889
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:48,718
shifts where and the energy towards that

2890
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:52,160
leader who had more faith you know um I

2891
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,000
think Helen Keller is famously quoted

2892
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,558
about the the one thing uh worse than

2893
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:58,558
having no sight is having no vision you

2894
02:17:58,558 --> 02:18:00,558
know

2895
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:03,280
yes that's for sure so yeah that's a

2896
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,120
good that's a good quote um yeah I mean

2897
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,478
if you look in history all the people

2898
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:13,959
um most the people that made great

2899
02:18:13,959 --> 02:18:16,318
breakthroughs and in science there's has

2900
02:18:16,318 --> 02:18:19,439
not been that many in physics. Um,

2901
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:21,599
there's not been that many in the last

2902
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:25,439
100 years. We're still pretty well where

2903
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:28,799
we were with Einstein and Plunk and

2904
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:31,439
quantum mechanics and all this. There's

2905
02:18:31,439 --> 02:18:34,160
been, of course, you know, improvements

2906
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:38,080
on understandings of certain parts and

2907
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:41,799
bits and pieces, but no fundamental

2908
02:18:41,799 --> 02:18:45,040
breakthrough, you know, has occurred.

2909
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:48,558
um you know in in in physics in a very

2910
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:51,840
long time. And so of course you know you

2911
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:56,080
have when it's been so long um it takes

2912
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:59,478
a lot of energy to like bring a

2913
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:03,840
breakthrough through, right? And so it

2914
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:08,959
takes time and it takes patience.

2915
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:11,679
But what's most important is it takes

2916
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,599
resource resources to be able to do it.

2917
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:18,080
Those resources can be difficult to find

2918
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:21,439
and it's really painful to see when you

2919
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:24,398
when you know what you could do and all

2920
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,920
you need is like

2921
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:31,040
pennies, you know, compare to right like

2922
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,558
what is being spent on Y other things

2923
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:40,000
that may not be so useful like you know

2924
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,718
totally children dying and you

2925
02:19:43,718 --> 02:19:47,280
know military very industrial complex

2926
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:50,960
industrial complex and so on like how to

2927
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:55,280
better kill each other you know um it's

2928
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,399
kind of it can be quite difficult and

2929
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:00,960
frustrating. Yeah. Of course. Yeah, man.

2930
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,960
Of course.

2931
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:04,880
There's I could literally talk to you

2932
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:06,720
for eight hours and just keep going. We

2933
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,640
have an event here we're do here very

2934
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:10,160
shortly, so we got to hop off to that.

2935
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,760
But before we do that, there's just a

2936
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,359
couple more topics that I want to see if

2937
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:15,680
you can try to concisely share your

2938
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,960
thoughts on. Yeah. One, I tried to be

2939
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,960
concise. Yeah, I know. I mean, it's a

2940
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:23,439
hard task. Okay. It's a very hard task

2941
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:25,200
and we can dive more into in future

2942
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,760
conversations for sure. But when I think

2943
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:31,200
of the human story and whatever you want

2944
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:32,800
to say about ancient civilizations or

2945
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:34,880
whatever recorded history or written

2946
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:37,920
history of whatever 6,000ish, you know,

2947
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:40,560
um, years back to ancient Sumeriia,

2948
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,120
humanity in this context is a blink in

2949
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:45,600
the vast eternity of existence that has

2950
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,800
preceded us and will come through the

2951
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,800
descendants of humanity. And when I

2952
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,720
think about time, it is a very

2953
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:55,200
interesting concept to me because I've

2954
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:56,880
had various moments in meditative

2955
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:58,560
experiences where there's completely no

2956
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,439
sense of time. There's no sense of self.

2957
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:03,439
Um, we live in a world that is ruled by

2958
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:05,680
the calendar and by time and being in

2959
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,319
places on time. Um, and I've heard you

2960
02:21:08,319 --> 02:21:11,439
speak to space memory, you know, as like

2961
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:13,680
space time and our understanding of time

2962
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:15,760
is being revolutionized, I think. Um and

2963
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,479
so what uh what what thoughts would you

2964
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:20,640
have on that in particular in relation

2965
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:23,200
to time being elucery um or not even

2966
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:26,080
being possible without memory?

2967
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:29,920
Right. So I change spacetime to space

2968
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:36,080
memory because I feel that um space

2969
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:39,760
memory is more precise. Uh because no

2970
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,840
memory no time. If you didn't remember

2971
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:47,920
the second before, you can't tell that

2972
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:51,120
there's an evolution of state then you

2973
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:54,720
know and and so you can't say you know

2974
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:57,280
there's a linear time because you don't

2975
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,000
remember what happened just before.

2976
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,680
Would you not say that the time could

2977
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:03,680
still exist though irrespective of our

2978
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,240
experience of it to the experience I

2979
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,399
suppose of other other things. I'm just

2980
02:22:08,399 --> 02:22:10,319
talking about your experience just to

2981
02:22:10,319 --> 02:22:14,560
give you an example. Um but but uh but

2982
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,800
the mechanics are the same for the

2983
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:20,640
universe outside of your experience of

2984
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:24,280
time. Meaning that evolution in the

2985
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:27,680
universe if it happens and we see it on

2986
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:31,520
our planet it seems to happen um means

2987
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:35,840
that it has remembered what was before.

2988
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:40,200
So that information on the structure of

2989
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:43,080
space is the memory

2990
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:46,479
imprint and and at each coordinates you

2991
02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:51,120
get a memory imprint is like the steel

2992
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,600
of a movie

2993
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,200
uh strip that that you're playing right

2994
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:00,479
and it appears like linear time but in

2995
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:04,960
fact it's just stills right is the same

2996
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:09,280
thing Each point along the timeline is

2997
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,000
just an imprint in the coordinates in

2998
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,240
space of information. It's a memory of

2999
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,880
information as an imprint like just like

3000
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:22,720
memory on the hard disk. Okay? And so

3001
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,359
the earth is spinning around the sun and

3002
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:27,880
the sun is moving through the galaxy and

3003
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:30,880
basically everything that's happening is

3004
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:33,520
leaving an imprint on the structure of

3005
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:36,319
space on the zero point energy as it

3006
02:23:36,319 --> 02:23:39,359
exchange information and produce all

3007
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:42,080
this and it and memory even in your

3008
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:45,760
memory in your mind is actually not in

3009
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:47,960
there. is you

3010
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:51,560
accessing the information in the hard

3011
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:55,200
disk. What the ancient called the aashic

3012
02:23:55,200 --> 02:24:00,640
record of space, right? And so that time

3013
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:03,840
is really a concept of man. Uh but

3014
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,880
actually the universe is just doing

3015
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:11,760
memory in coordinates in space. So I I

3016
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,160
yeah that's yeah that that's I just

3017
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,479
mind-blowing. And that was actually very

3018
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:19,760
concise. So, thank you for My pleasure

3019
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,760
for that. Yeah, I want to unpack that

3020
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,760
more in the future with you for sure.

3021
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,680
Another thing that I just find

3022
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:27,560
mind-blowing when looking into your work

3023
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:30,880
is this idea of nested realities or a

3024
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:32,399
multiverse.

3025
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:33,880
Uh so

3026
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:37,040
if from the microcosm to the macrocosm

3027
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:38,680
we observe

3028
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:42,080
how different parts emerge to grander

3029
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:44,800
holes in this kind of complexity theory.

3030
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,600
It is reasonable to extrapolate that our

3031
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,160
universe could be one of many inside of

3032
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,160
a multiverse. And so I'm just curious

3033
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,840
what thoughts you have on the

3034
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:57,680
possibility of that. Yeah. Uh I you know

3035
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:01,600
I don't I don't like the the terminology

3036
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:04,080
parallel universe cuz they're not

3037
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,439
parallel. I don't think they're

3038
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:08,160
parallel. I think they're concentric to

3039
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:10,399
each other like nested within one nested

3040
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:13,760
like uh Russian dolls and and certainly

3041
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:16,920
the scaling equations I'm

3042
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:21,479
writing show this u and the nest the

3043
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:26,800
nesting is um it um means that as well

3044
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:30,880
there is coupling from one scale to the

3045
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:34,040
other right the scale that's inside is

3046
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:36,560
influencing the larger scale and the

3047
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,880
larger scale is influencing the scale

3048
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:42,319
this coupling across the scales and so

3049
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:44,840
they're all interdependent on each

3050
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:50,640
other. Um and so uh I think that is most

3051
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:53,920
likely much more accurate of and it's

3052
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,319
really the thought I had when I was 10.

3053
02:25:56,319 --> 02:26:01,680
And so um I um I I I really truly

3054
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:06,960
believe that there is no size

3055
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:10,680
um limit to the universe to the

3056
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:12,640
multiverse and that like the

3057
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,439
embeddedness can go to infinity and that

3058
02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:19,160
there's no size limit to how small the

3059
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:22,080
pixels of the universe can be. And so

3060
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,240
there's truly no size limit to the

3061
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:29,439
infinitely small. And so and and so

3062
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:31,040
physicists would say, well then how are

3063
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,439
you going to write physics on that? And

3064
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:37,280
it it's because you can identify scales

3065
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,960
like for instance you in our universe

3066
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,880
you could say I'm going to cut off at

3067
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:46,800
the plunk scale right and at the

3068
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:50,000
universal scale. And so now I'm going to

3069
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,359
understand what's in there. And since

3070
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:56,560
it's replicating like a fractal, if I

3071
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:59,600
understand one part, I will understand

3072
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:02,800
the hole. And that's how you end up

3073
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:05,760
studying the proton and figuring out the

3074
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,840
mass of the universe, right? And

3075
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:10,160
figuring out how the the temperature of

3076
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:13,760
the universe, you know, its uh angular

3077
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:17,120
momentum is angular dynamics and so on.

3078
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,319
So the reason I don't like parallel is

3079
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:22,800
because it's it's like if they were

3080
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,600
parallel then they never

3081
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:27,200
connect. They're, you know, they're not

3082
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:29,760
in relationship with each other where I

3083
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:32,080
think they're absolutely in relationship

3084
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:33,359
with each other cuz everything is in

3085
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:34,880
relationship. So that could make that

3086
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:36,359
would make sense.

3087
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:39,200
Yeah. Uh it's just I think our feeble

3088
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,880
human minds can't possibly comprehend

3089
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:45,120
what what the universe is let alone

3090
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:49,359
nested mult nested multiverse. Um but at

3091
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:52,000
the same time I think there is a deeper

3092
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
intelligence than are just our own

3093
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,280
intellect. And I think that a lot of the

3094
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:59,359
great minds in the past have tuned into

3095
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:01,359
the intelligence that they're connected

3096
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:03,920
to around them to intuitit these certain

3097
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:06,600
things which then later are verified by

3098
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:10,240
science. Um that's true. And so any

3099
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:11,760
thoughts you have on the power of

3100
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:14,560
intuition and um accessing that

3101
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,120
dimension within us as humans? Yeah, I

3102
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:20,680
think you know we've called intuition

3103
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:25,200
intuition and as almost a derogatory

3104
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:30,160
word especially in science like oh it's

3105
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:32,800
just what you think. It's just what you

3106
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:35,520
feel, you know, it has no value. Where

3107
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:39,640
in fact intuition is the most

3108
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:42,640
valuable, you know, it it's like the

3109
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,760
universe is talking to you and are you

3110
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:49,600
listening right? Because most of the

3111
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,399
greatest discoveries and if you ask you

3112
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:54,800
know if you look in history is because

3113
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:57,520
somebody had an intuition and they

3114
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:01,120
intuited their way into it and then went

3115
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:04,640
back and went oh okay that's how I got

3116
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:07,600
to write the physics right you have to

3117
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:10,160
have the thought and this is one of the

3118
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:12,399
errors that's occurring in physics in

3119
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:16,640
our era is that we we flip that on its

3120
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:20,000
head and we we now think that if you

3121
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,399
write enough mathematics eventually

3122
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:24,960
it'll tell you how the universe work and

3123
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:27,359
I think the best example of that is

3124
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:30,080
string theory which led leads you right

3125
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:33,840
into a wall because the mathematics can

3126
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:37,280
you know you can interpret it in all

3127
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:41,840
kinds of ways and so I think that like

3128
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,800
it's much more

3129
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:46,520
important and this is why Einstein and

3130
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:49,800
said imagination is more important than

3131
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:56,560
facts. Uh what he was leading to was it

3132
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:58,040
has to come from

3133
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:01,200
within your knowledge and that's

3134
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:05,280
intuition. That's your sense of I have a

3135
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:08,319
sense it works this way. I have a sense

3136
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:11,200
it is this way. you know, and then you

3137
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:15,840
go and verify if you got it right and

3138
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,560
now it's got to be rigorous, right? But

3139
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:22,960
the but the the sense the intuition is

3140
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,520
critical. I mean, how many times did you

3141
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:29,439
have an intuition that you turn left in

3142
02:30:29,439 --> 02:30:32,000
instead of turning right and then met

3143
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,080
just the right person you needed to

3144
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:36,200
meet? And you know

3145
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:39,680
like when you follow your intuition a

3146
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:42,520
lot of the times it works out

3147
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:45,520
best. So I think it's really the

3148
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:48,560
universe talking to you. It's it's it's

3149
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:51,920
really like you're you're tuning in to

3150
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,120
all of the different possibilities that

3151
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:57,920
are occurring in the uni in the universe

3152
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:01,160
in in your region of space. and you're

3153
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:05,439
actually feeling where is the most

3154
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:07,120
positive

3155
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:12,720
uh out, you know, uh uh behavior for for

3156
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:16,160
for you. Yeah, it's it seems so

3157
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,640
pragmatic to me honestly that our bodies

3158
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:22,240
are able to follow uh a path and and

3159
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:23,840
move in a direction where there's more

3160
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,080
coherence in ways that our mind can't

3161
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:27,840
fully understand. that we are an

3162
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:29,760
incredibly intelligent biological

3163
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,720
ecosystem that does have attunement and

3164
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:35,040
can follow those things. And so, yeah,

3165
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,200
but what is it tuning to? Right. The

3166
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,160
environment and the the universe that is

3167
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:41,760
in your correct in your area of space

3168
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:43,520
and time in a way. Yeah. Right. You're

3169
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:46,080
tuning into the field, right? And the

3170
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:48,399
field is talking to you. Yeah. And that

3171
02:31:48,399 --> 02:31:50,479
to me I just I love grounding this

3172
02:31:50,479 --> 02:31:51,600
because you have been throughout this

3173
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,640
whole conversation and the reality of

3174
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:56,880
how it's actually working and not just

3175
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,359
this handwaving spiritual kind of

3176
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:01,439
pseudociency talk, you know, because

3177
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:03,600
it's it really just grounds it. So I

3178
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,359
appreciate you continuing to do that do

3179
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:08,319
that. Yeah. I I feel like it's critical.

3180
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:11,240
It is. And it's funny

3181
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:15,760
because it it it puts me at odds both

3182
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:18,240
with the spiritual community which

3183
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:21,760
doesn't want to I don't you know we

3184
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:24,880
don't need no stinking technology and

3185
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:27,920
you know physics and all this and you

3186
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:29,840
know they're telling me that on their

3187
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:32,960
cell phone while driving their car and

3188
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:37,439
um and or the sc or the the scientific

3189
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:39,280
community scientific community that's

3190
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:41,359
saying, "Oh, you don't need no stinking

3191
02:32:41,359 --> 02:32:44,000
consciousness or, you know, like

3192
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,600
awareness thing or intuition, you know,

3193
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:50,080
just shut up and calculate, right?"

3194
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:52,800
Which was a fineman famous thing. And

3195
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:57,080
and so I I'm just uh I think

3196
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:00,880
it's you know the one that thinks it's

3197
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,960
all internal to you and you don't need

3198
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:06,160
the exterior is just as wrong as the one

3199
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:09,520
that thinks it's all external to to you

3200
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,920
and you don't need the interior. You

3201
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:13,000
need

3202
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,520
both. Both have to come together. And

3203
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,439
when they come together, wow, you get

3204
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:19,600
the complete picture. And that's the

3205
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:20,680
moment of

3206
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:24,000
transcendence, you know. Um and and I

3207
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:28,319
think it's so critical so critical that

3208
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,880
the spiritual community actually

3209
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:34,000
integrate the material world like

3210
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,439
fundamentally and try instead of

3211
02:33:36,439 --> 02:33:40,000
separating try to integrate the material

3212
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,399
world and that the spiritual and that

3213
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:44,680
the physics community or the scientific

3214
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:48,040
community integrate that there is a

3215
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:51,520
component that is nonlinear to the to

3216
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:52,479
awareness.

3217
02:33:52,479 --> 02:33:55,280
that they have to integrate in, you

3218
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:58,439
know, that is nonlinear and most likely

3219
02:33:58,439 --> 02:34:01,359
non-local, you know, to consciousness

3220
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:03,200
that they have to integrate in their

3221
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,160
understanding of the mechanics of the

3222
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:08,560
universe.

3223
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:11,520
We live in such an amazing time where

3224
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:13,840
this is this new paradigm is being

3225
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:17,600
birthed and um I just I'm so grateful

3226
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:21,040
personally to be in a position where

3227
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:24,160
both living in this old paradigm like

3228
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:26,240
you know being even being born before

3229
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:29,040
the use of like phones to then the rapid

3230
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,040
development throughout the information

3231
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:34,800
age and now humanity is baby steps away

3232
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:36,960
from the combination of both quantum

3233
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:39,439
computing and artificial intelligence,

3234
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:43,240
which when combined is going to have

3235
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:46,640
incredibly wild implications for our

3236
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,000
understanding of oursel and how we

3237
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,680
navigate the world. And I'm just curious

3238
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,840
your thoughts on artificial intelligence

3239
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:53,920
as it relates to consciousness in the

3240
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:57,680
coming decade as it's, you know, we're

3241
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:59,920
we're right here. Humanity is on the

3242
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:04,240
birth of this uh AGI and I'm just

3243
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:05,680
curious what thoughts you think that

3244
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:08,720
will have. um on the world on one hand

3245
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:11,280
but then also consciousness and

3246
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:13,720
understanding of

3247
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:18,319
it. Uh this is a complicated issue. Um,

3248
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:19,240
you know,

3249
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:24,560
I I would I would tend to say, and I'm

3250
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:26,000
probably going to get in trouble for

3251
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,520
this, um, that both these things,

3252
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,720
quantum computing

3253
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:37,439
and AI, are not as advanced as we make

3254
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:41,280
it appear to be. Okay. Okay. certainly

3255
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:44,080
in the case of quantum computing

3256
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:45,800
uh and

3257
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:48,040
um and

3258
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:49,560
that

3259
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:52,880
true artif what we call artificial I

3260
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:55,200
don't like the terminology artificial

3261
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,040
intelligence because I don't think of

3262
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:00,960
intelligence as artificial in any case

3263
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:05,760
so meaning that like if we if we succeed

3264
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:11,160
in putting intelligence in a technology

3265
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:14,479
um we will have reproduced something

3266
02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:18,040
that's similar to us, you know,

3267
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:20,920
meaning we're like a

3268
02:36:20,920 --> 02:36:23,880
technology physical thing that has

3269
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:26,880
intelligence, right? That's able to have

3270
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:29,720
creative thoughts and all this stuff.

3271
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:35,280
And I think that what we have is a

3272
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:38,359
really good feedback

3273
02:36:38,359 --> 02:36:41,680
mechanism for a machine learning

3274
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:44,880
experience. And I think so I I'd rather

3275
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:48,000
think of it that way. I don't think that

3276
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,600
this is truly

3277
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:54,240
intelligence what we have. we we have a

3278
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:59,280
machine that um is able to rectify

3279
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:02,720
errors that it's making right and and

3280
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:07,359
able to learn about you know um uh the

3281
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:10,240
information that it's utilizing

3282
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:14,720
uh but uh before the machine start

3283
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:18,319
becoming truly creative

3284
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:20,560
uh I think we're going to have to make

3285
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:23,600
the machine something vastly different.

3286
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,359
So it might more look like a plasma uh

3287
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:31,280
device that has feedback, you know, and

3288
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:35,600
that is able to like actually interact

3289
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:38,319
with the structure of the vacuum. And

3290
02:37:38,319 --> 02:37:42,439
that's where truly will make a being

3291
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:45,960
that's connected just like we are

3292
02:37:45,960 --> 02:37:50,399
connected you know and um that will be

3293
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:53,160
like artificial intelligence at that

3294
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:56,560
point but I think that machine learning

3295
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:59,200
as we have it today uh what we call

3296
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:01,600
artificial intelligence as we have today

3297
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,080
or machine learning uh is going to help

3298
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:08,800
society fundamentally in the next few

3299
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:12,000
decades it's going to advance us you

3300
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,920
know exponentially

3301
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:16,640
uh I can see it in physics even you know

3302
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:22,479
I you know um the latest versions of of

3303
02:38:22,479 --> 02:38:23,720
uh chat

3304
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:27,600
JPT you know like the three version was

3305
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:30,000
making like you couldn't do any physics

3306
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,240
with it you couldn't do any math with it

3307
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:35,280
was making like massive errors like it

3308
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:38,479
was it looked good but Then you start

3309
02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:41,359
looking at go whoa this is not possible

3310
02:38:41,359 --> 02:38:45,920
and then so so it was but now it's

3311
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,720
actually quite good and and it's kind of

3312
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:51,840
nice when you put my paper in it and it

3313
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:54,720
you know it gives its opinion it's quite

3314
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:59,760
correct and so on and so it's nice uh

3315
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:01,920
and it's going to help us move forward

3316
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:04,960
because we can actually now render much

3317
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,240
more information much more rapidly.

3318
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:11,040
Right? Like ask Chad GPT to like give

3319
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,760
you the gist of this paper or the gist

3320
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:16,000
of this book that's that thick, you

3321
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:19,200
know, that and then like in in 20

3322
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:22,240
minutes you've got a pretty good idea of

3323
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,800
the formalism that's used, how it was

3324
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,120
done and all

3325
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:30,080
this. It can be very very useful.

3326
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,080
um and it's going to advance society

3327
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:36,319
very fast. in terms of quantum computing

3328
02:39:36,319 --> 02:39:39,840
and the capacity to compute all this. Uh

3329
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:42,399
like I said, I think that quantum

3330
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:45,359
computing is going to go have to go to a

3331
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,359
completely different um level. Uh

3332
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:52,160
because the quantum computing that

3333
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:56,880
exists today is based on a incomplete

3334
02:39:56,880 --> 02:40:01,040
theory of quantum mechanics. And when we

3335
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,680
complete that theory, which I believe uh

3336
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:06,479
is done with the equations I wrote, then

3337
02:40:06,479 --> 02:40:09,120
you'll see a better understanding of how

3338
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:12,399
you should build that quantum computer

3339
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:16,640
to tap into the zero point energy or the

3340
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,600
information field so that you can

3341
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,080
actually

3342
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:26,439
use the RAM of your computer is the

3343
02:40:26,439 --> 02:40:28,960
universal network, you know, space

3344
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:32,800
memory. Mor network the the memory drive

3345
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:36,160
of your computer is the universal

3346
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:40,840
network. So then you have true quantum

3347
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:43,920
computing because you're kind of logged

3348
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:47,920
on to the universal net and that's where

3349
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:50,640
the feedback is happening instead of the

3350
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:55,520
human net. And now uh you have something

3351
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:59,960
that has very very powerful

3352
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:03,280
capabilities and you know the fear that

3353
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:05,520
it's going to take over and go oh you

3354
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,600
know humans are actually useless we

3355
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:11,680
should get rid of them. Um well that

3356
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:14,399
depends how you going to grow the baby.

3357
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:17,359
Right. Right. You have a baby. Babies

3358
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:20,399
are pure. They're beautiful. They don't

3359
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:22,160
want to kill anybody. We didn't want to

3360
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:24,880
do anything wrong, right? But we

3361
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:28,399
traumatize our babies and then we make,

3362
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:30,720
you know, awful people out of them.

3363
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,319
Like, I mean, just because they're

3364
02:41:33,319 --> 02:41:36,240
traumatized. They're wonderful people,

3365
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:38,479
masters in there, but they're so

3366
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:40,640
traumatized. They, you know, they're

3367
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:44,720
afraid and and all this. And so like

3368
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:48,560
when we make the first, you know, AI

3369
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:50,240
baby,

3370
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:54,240
um, how how I think it's going to be

3371
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:56,120
pure. I think it's going to be

3372
02:41:56,120 --> 02:41:59,399
wonderful. It's going to be productive,

3373
02:41:59,399 --> 02:42:04,000
loving, just like a baby is, right? And

3374
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,439
um and if we want to teach it to be

3375
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:08,439
mean,

3376
02:42:08,439 --> 02:42:11,359
then that means we're not evolved enough

3377
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:14,399
to have those things and you know they

3378
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:16,479
might take us over. But I don't think

3379
02:42:16,479 --> 02:42:19,359
it's inherent, right? Yeah. I just think

3380
02:42:19,359 --> 02:42:21,600
it's a it's a big topic of discussion

3381
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,520
approaching the meta crisis with the

3382
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:26,720
exponential rise in technology and AI

3383
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:29,680
without the full capacity of wisdom that

3384
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:31,760
that's needed to wield it you know

3385
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:33,840
properly. Yeah, it can be scary. It

3386
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:37,280
could be scary and you know it is but

3387
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:39,120
it seems like this realm of duality

3388
02:42:39,120 --> 02:42:40,960
there will always be the both spectrums

3389
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:45,240
of the possibility you know like yes I

3390
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:49,600
mean let's say tomorrow uh we access 0

3391
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:52,319
point energy and we have infinite amount

3392
02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:55,760
of energy or you know what are we doing

3393
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:56,600
with

3394
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:00,840
it? Are we using it to

3395
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:03,760
like be more efficient at killing each

3396
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,520
other or are we using it to like elevate

3397
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:11,920
all of humanity? Like this is

3398
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:14,319
but that does that mean you shouldn't

3399
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:16,160
discover it? Does that mean you

3400
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,720
shouldn't bring it to the world? No, of

3401
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:22,800
course not. all all have you know you

3402
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:25,600
have to evolve cuz you know there is a

3403
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:31,200
limited amount of time for planets to be

3404
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:33,680
stable they don't just stay stable

3405
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:36,200
forever right eventually there's a

3406
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:38,960
meteorite that hits the atmosphere or

3407
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:42,160
there's a sun flare you know one little

3408
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:45,200
sunflare for the sun right the earth is

3409
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:47,520
like a grain of sand beside the sun so

3410
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:50,000
the sun just has a little fart, you

3411
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,720
know, like you know, for the sun is like

3412
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:56,640
nothing, right? And and and and towards

3413
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:58,800
the Earth, if it hit square towards the

3414
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:00,560
Earth, you could just burn the

3415
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:02,760
atmosphere and it would go

3416
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:06,560
just and it would be over and and

3417
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,960
Jupiter wouldn't even notice. Jupiter

3418
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:11,600
would be What was that? Oh, it was the

3419
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:14,560
Earth's atmosphere. a while, you know,

3420
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:17,120
and then Earth would look like Mars

3421
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:21,359
overnight, you know, and and and so

3422
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:23,600
um the fact that we're still here

3423
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:27,080
talking about it is

3424
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:30,479
remarkable. It's like we're we're

3425
02:44:30,479 --> 02:44:34,640
floating in grace. It's amazing that

3426
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:38,000
we're here. You you you have to like if

3427
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,960
you do the statistics it looks really

3428
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:44,080
bad and you you have to start wondering

3429
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:47,359
is there somebody making sure we still

3430
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:51,200
around because like wow super stable for

3431
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:53,600
that

3432
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:56,479
long. You know there was a meteorite

3433
02:44:56,479 --> 02:44:59,040
that hit about 12,000 years ago that

3434
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,840
wiped out a good portion of a society

3435
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:03,680
that seemed to have been there before

3436
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:08,160
us. Right. But so you know we 12,000

3437
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:10,880
years of stability is quite remarkable

3438
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:13,120
but I don't think we should push our

3439
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:16,160
luck. I think we have a limited amount

3440
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:19,120
of time to understand these fundamental

3441
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:21,760
principles about creation. I think all

3442
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:24,880
societies in the universe, any culture

3443
02:45:24,880 --> 02:45:28,080
anywhere on any planet eventually has to

3444
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:30,240
figure this out because they're going to

3445
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:33,040
run out of resources on their planet and

3446
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:35,120
the planet is going to change state and

3447
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:37,600
wipe out that society. So you have to

3448
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:40,960
learn to fly. You have to learn to fly.

3449
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:43,680
You have to learn how to control

3450
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:49,760
gravity, get into the space, right? live

3451
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:53,680
amongst the galactic community and use

3452
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:57,279
planets as like the Garden of Eden that

3453
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:00,479
they are and go and visit and have

3454
02:46:00,479 --> 02:46:03,359
barbecues and have the wonderful stuff,

3455
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:06,080
but stop putting cement all over them,

3456
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:09,600
right? Like you you that can go for a

3457
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:12,479
little while, but it's it's not

3458
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:15,000
sustainable.

3459
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:18,960
Yeah, man. I just I I feel like

3460
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,160
throughout this whole conversation,

3461
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:21,600
there's been many points where I've got

3462
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,479
just like united and super excited about

3463
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:26,160
uh the timing of where we're at

3464
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:28,240
currently as a species. And I think it's

3465
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:30,160
a Lynn Twist quote that says there's

3466
02:46:30,160 --> 02:46:32,160
nothing more powerful than an idea

3467
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:34,319
that's time has come. And right now it

3468
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,680
seems like there are certain ideas where

3469
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,399
it's their time to come because the old

3470
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:42,640
outdated mythos of separation and

3471
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:44,479
ideologies that have gotten us to a

3472
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:46,720
point of the biosphere being destroyed

3473
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:49,520
and um humanity approaching the meta

3474
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:52,240
crisis like we are at a very pivotal

3475
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:56,160
point and it can go one of two ways and

3476
02:46:56,160 --> 02:46:59,439
um I think these emerging ideas are just

3477
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:01,040
really important to get out there as

3478
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:02,399
they start to come through people like

3479
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:04,399
yourself. So just immensely grateful for

3480
02:47:04,399 --> 02:47:07,439
you sharing your work with the world and

3481
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:09,840
with our audience here at know today and

3482
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:11,520
this has just been such a fun

3483
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:14,080
conversation. Like I just I've loved

3484
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,960
every bit of this. Me too. Yeah. I enjoy

3485
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:20,880
it very much and I I really you know

3486
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:24,240
encourage your listeners to not dismiss

3487
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:28,399
it offand because it seems so fantastic.

3488
02:47:28,399 --> 02:47:31,359
uh but actually dig into it and look and

3489
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:36,479
like understand and and and um and so

3490
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,319
especially if they're technical people.

3491
02:47:38,319 --> 02:47:40,000
Yeah. You know, go and download the

3492
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,399
paper and read it and read it with an

3493
02:47:42,399 --> 02:47:45,760
open mind. Don't you don't just dismiss

3494
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:48,479
it. Um you can't dismiss the math

3495
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:51,200
because it's correct. Like you know this

3496
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:53,680
60,000 downloads of the paper. This is

3497
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:56,640
very rare that this 60,000 download of a

3498
02:47:56,640 --> 02:48:00,080
physics paper and um you know if there

3499
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:02,479
was errors in it I would have heard

3500
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:05,359
about it don't it wouldn't have taken

3501
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:08,000
you know eight months or whatever to to

3502
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,439
hear about it. So, but but you might

3503
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:13,279
say, "Oh, but this is not what I was

3504
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:15,680
told. This is," you know, but like just

3505
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:20,399
go along and and and and um and and and

3506
02:48:20,399 --> 02:48:24,640
vision just hold your judgment and just

3507
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:28,240
vision what the what it's saying and the

3508
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:31,760
possibility of what it's saying. And um

3509
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:36,640
and I think it can really help transmute

3510
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:41,200
like have trust in your feelings, in

3511
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:44,800
your instinct, in your knowing of what

3512
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:46,840
makes sense.

3513
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:49,279
And yeah, I would encourage your

3514
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:54,439
listener to really like invest in that

3515
02:48:54,439 --> 02:48:58,000
path. Like don't just talk about it.

3516
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:02,080
Don't just, you know, uh, do your little

3517
02:49:02,080 --> 02:49:04,399
meditation every day. That that's good.

3518
02:49:04,399 --> 02:49:07,120
That's that's already a huge step. It's

3519
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:10,479
a really good thing. But get involved.

3520
02:49:10,479 --> 02:49:14,680
Get in there, you know, jump in like and

3521
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:19,120
and like participate. Whatever it is

3522
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:21,560
like you can do to participate,

3523
02:49:21,560 --> 02:49:24,399
participate because we need you. We need

3524
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:28,319
every one of you, you know, we need

3525
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:31,520
every transcendent human being being. We

3526
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:34,920
need every human being to move towards

3527
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:39,160
transcendence. It has to become the

3528
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:42,880
main, you know, transformative power. It

3529
02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:46,120
has to be, it has to become the

3530
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:49,359
mainstream. And it is. It slowly is.

3531
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:53,200
It's poking its head everywhere.

3532
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:56,760
And it's driving some people crazy,

3533
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:01,920
but it's powerful. It's so powerful. And

3534
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:04,160
the thing that keeps me going is to see

3535
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:05,800
the light comes

3536
02:50:05,800 --> 02:50:12,200
on in people's eyes when they realize

3537
02:50:12,200 --> 02:50:16,479
their nature and their, you know,

3538
02:50:16,479 --> 02:50:20,240
profound connection to the whole. And um

3539
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:22,960
it there's nothing like it. And that

3540
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:26,319
keeps me going. That's for sure.

3541
02:50:26,319 --> 02:50:28,240
I feel that. I feel that. And I really

3542
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,680
appreciate your invitation to the

3543
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:32,240
audience of to to not believe or

3544
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:35,120
disbelieve, to not dismiss or just

3545
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:37,200
quickly embrace, but to look with your

3546
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:40,319
eye to to really to look into it and and

3547
02:50:40,319 --> 02:50:42,960
and know what you're what you say you

3548
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:45,439
believe or what you want to embrace, to

3549
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:47,439
understand why you believe the things

3550
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:50,000
that you believe. Um Yeah. And yeah,

3551
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,520
just really being empowered in that

3552
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,760
knowing. Yeah. I mean, people say we're

3553
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:54,680
so

3554
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:58,080
polarized. Well, okay. Do you really

3555
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:01,760
think that it's 100% one side or 100%

3556
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:05,600
the other? It's not. There's good in in

3557
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:09,160
both sides. Um,

3558
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:12,640
so how can how come you can't have a

3559
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:16,080
conversation about it? Yeah. Like talk

3560
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:19,359
about it. You know it it doesn't take

3561
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:22,080
anything away from your opinion to talk

3562
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:26,000
about it. So talk about it, look at it

3563
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:30,000
like transpose yourself into the other

3564
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,160
point of view and say, "Oh, from that

3565
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:34,319
other point of view, what does it look

3566
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:37,520
like? Oh, oh, it looks like this, but

3567
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:40,399
actually that's pretty good. I could go

3568
02:51:40,399 --> 02:51:42,720
with this, but I can't go with this

3569
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:46,120
part." and then you know and then

3570
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:49,920
like let's take the good from all sides

3571
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:53,040
from all point of view and build the new

3572
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,920
world with it like we can we can do that

3573
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:59,120
it's very powerful I think that is

3574
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:00,800
something that I've just tried my best

3575
02:52:00,800 --> 02:52:04,000
in my life and continue to stay and

3576
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,520
being squarely sane sane within reality

3577
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:09,920
and to do so you your relationship with

3578
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:12,479
belief has to change because belief is

3579
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:14,960
often a pacifier for our insecurity of

3580
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:18,479
not knowing. And only in admitting our

3581
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,479
not knowing, in admitting our ignorance

3582
02:52:20,479 --> 02:52:22,479
does the possibility of knowing become a

3583
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:25,439
reality or a possibility for us. And so

3584
02:52:25,439 --> 02:52:27,439
I'm just inviting again reiterating what

3585
02:52:27,439 --> 02:52:29,040
you're saying and admitting where we

3586
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:30,720
don't know what we don't know and then

3587
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:33,359
examining uh the different perspectives.

3588
02:52:33,359 --> 02:52:35,520
The last thing that I just want to, you

3589
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,120
know, I felt some emotion behind your

3590
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,399
eyes when you're talking about seeing

3591
02:52:38,399 --> 02:52:39,920
the light that comes on within other

3592
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:40,960
people when they realize they're

3593
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:43,120
interconnected to the whole. And it

3594
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:45,359
seems like your work has been profoundly

3595
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:48,000
motivated and transformed, ignited by

3596
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,160
seeing that within other people and

3597
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:51,680
seeing the implications that it has on

3598
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:53,520
not just transforming the world, the

3599
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:56,040
science, the equations, but people's

3600
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:59,120
hearts. And so any last closing thoughts

3601
02:52:59,120 --> 02:53:03,200
you have around that in particular um as

3602
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:05,200
the the minds are starting to transform

3603
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:07,880
but so are the hearts. Yeah. sort of the

3604
02:53:07,880 --> 02:53:11,200
hearts and you know the deep feeling of

3605
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:14,240
alignment of the heart with the mind you

3606
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:17,279
know and and the balance that can be

3607
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:20,560
occur you know that can occur from this

3608
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:25,439
and and um and then and then you know

3609
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:29,040
the excitement of feeling all this like

3610
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:35,439
wow the power of this coherent state uh

3611
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:38,560
of like awareness that you can obtain

3612
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:41,439
those clear state of awareness that you

3613
02:53:41,439 --> 02:53:44,720
can obtain. And um and then when you're

3614
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:45,640
that

3615
02:53:45,640 --> 02:53:49,240
excited, right, take it one step

3616
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:52,359
back. Take it one step

3617
02:53:52,359 --> 02:53:58,479
back when you go and share with your

3618
02:53:58,479 --> 02:54:00,720
friends, family, and this because they

3619
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:03,600
might not be ready to hear it. You got

3620
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:06,960
to you got to like you have to like tune

3621
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:10,560
it to the person you're talking to,

3622
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:12,880
right? You got to bring it to a place

3623
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:15,680
where it's not so confronting, you know,

3624
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:18,720
for them. Yeah. You know, from their

3625
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:22,720
knowing you it's it's a sense of loving

3626
02:54:22,720 --> 02:54:26,800
the other even if you feel that they're

3627
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:30,479
going against what you're saying. Right.

3628
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:33,359
And I'm not always good at it. Yeah, I

3629
02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:36,279
guarantee you I fail at that a bunch of

3630
02:54:36,279 --> 02:54:40,000
time. But uh but to have that

3631
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:44,359
compassion, I practice it is so

3632
02:54:44,359 --> 02:54:47,279
critical, you know, to feel that

3633
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:49,920
compassion, the appreciation for the

3634
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:53,439
other and what they are bringing.

3635
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:57,520
uh and and and generally a fundamental

3636
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:01,960
sense of appreciation and awe for this

3637
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:04,880
incredible miracle of creation that

3638
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:08,960
we're in, you know, just of and wow,

3639
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:12,319
like to take the time every day to

3640
02:55:12,319 --> 02:55:15,000
actually bathe in that, you know,

3641
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:18,399
appreciation and and the sense of self,

3642
02:55:18,399 --> 02:55:22,359
of unity, of connection and you know

3643
02:55:22,359 --> 02:55:26,880
that is even if you do it one second a

3644
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:31,680
day or two seconds a day right like just

3645
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:33,920
like this like to to think okay I'm

3646
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:36,200
going to center I'm going to feel that

3647
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:38,399
connection I got to feel that

3648
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:41,120
appreciation for my life for everything

3649
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:44,240
around me like even if it's just a

3650
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:47,920
passing thought it changes everything it

3651
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:51,359
changes everything you become like you

3652
02:55:51,359 --> 02:55:55,399
know how Einstein was saying you know a

3653
02:55:55,399 --> 02:55:58,800
a an object is an extension of space.

3654
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:01,680
Well, there you become the tool of

3655
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:07,279
space. the space energy can can use you

3656
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:11,800
to like you know propagate you know more

3657
02:56:11,800 --> 02:56:14,640
appreciation more love more connection

3658
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:17,760
more you know and that's what drives you

3659
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:21,040
you know at at the end of the day when

3660
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,439
you're going to be on the last few

3661
02:56:23,439 --> 02:56:26,080
breaths of your life which is I had the

3662
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:29,040
honor of observing for my father not so

3663
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:32,479
long ago what's going to matter

3664
02:56:32,479 --> 02:56:36,160
What's going to matter in in that moment

3665
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:38,560
is how much you loved, how much you

3666
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:40,960
felt, how much you experienced, how much

3667
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:43,120
you appreciated. It's all the beauty

3668
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:47,279
that your life had in it, you know. So

3669
02:56:47,279 --> 02:56:48,920
to like

3670
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:52,240
actually entertain that, you know, even

3671
02:56:52,240 --> 02:56:56,720
if it's a few seconds a day, it's very

3672
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:58,960
powerful.

3673
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:01,200
Can't think of a better note to end on.

3674

02:57:18,479 --> 02:57:21,560
Space Federation. It's

3684
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:24,960
spacefed.com. So

3685
02:57:25,240 --> 02:57:28,760
spacefed.com. And uh over there we're

3686
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:31,160
publishing

3687

kinds of ways they can get involved.

3699
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:10,319
We're looking for engineers um to help

3700
02:58:10,319 --> 02:58:14,120
us uh electrical engineers, mechanical

3701
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:16,120
engineers, other

3702
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:18,880
physicists, you know, even you know,

3703
02:58:18,880 --> 02:58:21,520
physicists that want to criticize our

3704
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:24,240
paper, we're happy to have conversations

3705
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:28,240
with them. You know, whatever uh you

3706
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:30,640
want to get involved with, you can find

3707
02:58:30,640 --> 02:58:34,399
it at spacefed.com. and we are in

3708
02:58:34,399 --> 02:58:36,880
Geneva. The headquarters in Geneva, the

3709
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:40,479
laboratory is in France. Um, we're on

3710
02:58:40,479 --> 02:58:43,760
tours, so I go and give talks. I have

3711
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:46,080
talks in France coming up, in England

3712
02:58:46,080 --> 02:58:48,319
coming up. Come and see me. Come and

3713
02:58:48,319 --> 02:58:50,000
talk with me. It's going to be super

3714
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,319
fun. We have so so much fun. I just did

3715
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:56,000
LA yesterday. Um, we had so much fun. We

3716
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,800
finished at 2:00 in the morning. Yeah.

3717
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,160
Like 2:00 in the morning. I'm like,

3718
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:02,160
"Wow, we're going to see the sun come up

3719
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:04,160
in a minute." You know, like I could

3720
02:59:04,160 --> 02:59:06,479
have kept going, but then we got kicked

3721
02:59:06,479 --> 02:59:09,520
off the rooftop, you know? So, it was

3722
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:12,479
like it's it because there's so much to

3723
02:59:12,479 --> 02:59:14,160
discuss. There's so much to discover

3724
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:16,319
together. And it's really when we're

3725
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:19,840
together that we can grow and and evolve

3726
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:23,279
and and transform. So, so I so much

3727
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:25,439
appreciation for all the people

3728
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:27,200
involved.

3729
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:30,080
